# 10th Tank Corps
The 10th Tank Corps was a tank corps of the Red Army, formed twice.

## First Formation
In May–June 1938, the 7th Mechanized Corps headquarters was relocated from Novy Petergof to Luga and converted into the 10th Tank Corps when the Red Army mechanized forces transitioned from a mechanized corps structure to a tank corps structure. On 4 August 1938, the 107th Separate Air Liaison Flight was formed as part of the corps at Luga. On 27 September 1939, the corps was relocated to the Pskov area on the Estonian border, to back up threats of force against that country. On 2 October it was moved to the Latvian border to threaten Latvia as well. Both of these movements were made to force the two Baltic states into signing the Soviet–Estonian Mutual Assistance Treaty and the Soviet–Latvian Mutual Assistance Treaty, respectively, which established Soviet military bases on the territory of both countries. On 10 October, the 18th Light Tank Brigade was transferred to another unit and replaced by the 1st Light Tank Brigade. The corps' other brigades were the 13th Light Tank Brigade and the 15th Motor Rifle and Machine Gun Brigade.
On 13 October the corps was transferred back to the Leningrad Military District from the 8th Army and returned to Luga. By 30 November, in preparation for the Winter War, the Soviet attack on Finland, the 10th was relocated to the Finnish border as part of the 7th Army. On 30 November, the corps crossed the border at the beginning of the invasion, with its headquarters in the Korkiamyaki area, then at Rautu and Liipua. Between 13 and 16 December the 10th Tank Corps was transferred to advance towards Vyborg, concentrating in the Baboshino area. Its units were pulled out of combat and moved to Baboshin, with the headquarters at Tomilla by 20 December.
The Red Army command considered the performance of the large tank corps to be unsatisfactory and ordered all of them, including the 10th, disbanded in January 1940 by an order dated 17 January. The corps headquarters was moved to Kingisepp to be used to form an army group under the command of  Dmitry Pavlov.

## Second Formation
The corps was reformed in April 1942 and was part of Steppe Front for the Battle of Kursk. Fatyh Zaripovich Sharipov appears to have won the Hero of the Soviet Union while operating with the corps.
10th Tank Corps was subsequently assigned to the 5th Guards Tank Army, but by April 1945 during the Battle of Berlin, the 10th Tank Corps was part of the Reserve of the Supreme High Command (RVGK). It comprised the 178th, 183rd, and 186th Tank Brigades, and the 11th Motor Rifle Brigade.
It should not be confused with 30th Tank Corps, which became 10th Guards Tank Corps.
Postwar it became the 10th Tank Division. On 30 April 1957, it became the 34th Heavy Tank Division. In March 1965, it became the 34th Tank Division. On 20 March 1992, it was taken over by Belarus. The division became the 34th Weapons and Equipment Storage Base, part of North Western Operational Command.
# 1113–1115 Balearic Islands expedition
In 1114, an expedition to the Balearic Islands, then a Muslim taifa, was launched in the form of a Crusade. Founded on a treaty of 1113 between the Republic of Pisa and Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona, the expedition had the support of Pope Paschal II and the participation of many lords of Catalonia and Occitania, as well as contingents from northern and central Italy, Sardinia, and Corsica. The Crusaders were perhaps inspired by the Norwegian king Sigurd I's attack on Formentera in 1108 or 1109 during the Norwegian Crusade. The expedition ended in 1115 in the conquest of the Balearics, but only until the next year. The main source for the event is the Pisan Liber maiolichinus, completed by 1125.

## Treaty and preparations
In 1085 Pope Gregory VII had granted suzerainty over the Balearics to Pisa. In September 1113 a Pisan fleet making an expedition to Majorca was put off course by a storm and ended up near Blanes on the coast of Catalonia, which they initially mistook for the Balearics. The Pisans met with the Count of Barcelona in the port of Sant Feliu de Guíxols, where on 7 September they signed a treaty causa corroborandae societatis et amicitiae ('for strengthening [their] alliance and friendship'). Specifically the Pisans were exempted from the usagium and the jus naufragii in all the territories, present and future, of the Count of Barcelona, though Arles and Saint-Gilles, in the recently acquired March of Provence, were singled out for special mention (three times).
The only surviving copy of the treaty between Pisa and Barcelona is found interpolated in a charter of James I granted to Pisa in 1233. It affirms that the meeting was unplanned and apparently arranged by God. Some scholars have expressed doubt about the lack of preparation, citing the Catalans' rapid response to the presence of the Pisans as evidence of some previous contact. The attribution of the meeting to Providence alone may have been concocted to add an "aura of sacredness" to the alliance and the crusade.
The treaty, or what survives of it, does not refer to military cooperation or a venture against Majorca; perhaps that agreement was oral, or perhaps its record has been lost, but a Crusade was planned for 1114. The chief goal was the freeing of Christian captives and the suppression of Muslim piracy. Most of the Pisan fleet returned to Pisa, but some ships damaged by the storm remained to be repaired and some men remained behind to construct siege engines. In the spring of 1114 a new fleet of eighty ships arrived from Pisa, following the French coast, briefly staying at Marseille.
The fleet brought with it Cardinal Bosone, an envoy from Paschal II, who vigorously supported the expedition, authorising it in a bull as early as 1113. Paschal had also granted the Pisans the Romana signa, sedis apostolicae vexillum ("Roman standard, the flag of the apostolic see"), and his appeals for the expedition had borne fruit. Besides the 300 ships of the Pisan contingent, there were 120 Catalan and Occitan vessels (plus a large army), contingents from the Italian cities of Florence, Lucca, Pistoia, Rome, Siena, and Volterra, and from Sardinia and Corsica under Saltaro, the son of Constantine I of Logudoro. Among the Catalan princes there were Ramon Berenguer, Hug II of Empúries, and Ramon Folc II of Cardona. The most important lords of Occitania participated, with the exception of the Count of Toulouse, Alfonso Jordan: William V of Montpellier, with twenty ships; Aimeric II of Narbonne, with twenty ships; and Raymond I of Baux, with seven ships. Bernard Ato IV, the chief of the Trencavel family, also participated. Ramon Berenguer and his wife, Douce, borrowed 100 morabatins from the Ramon Guillem, the Bishop of Barcelona, to finance the expedition.

## Conquest and loss
The combined Crusader fleet raided Ibiza in June, and destroyed its defences, since Ibiza lay between Majorca and the mainland and would have posed a continued threat during a siege. The Liber maiolichinus also records the taking of captives, who were trying to hide in careae (probably caves), on Formentera. Ibiza was under Crusader control by August. The Crusaders invested Palma de Majorca in August 1114. As the siege dragged on the counts of Barcelona and Empúries entered into peace negotiations with the Muslim ruler of Majorca, but the cardinal and Pietro Moriconi, the Archbishop of Pisa, interfered to put an end to the discussions. Probably the Catalan rulers, whose lands lay nearest the Balearics, expected an annual payment of parias (tribute) from the Muslims and the cessation of pirate raids in return for lifting the siege.
Muslim reinforcements, Almoravids from the Iberian port of Denia, surprised a Pisan flotilla of six in the waters off Ibiza, with only two of the Pisan vessels making it to safety, which consisted of the remains of a fortress burned by the king of Norway a decade earlier. In April 1115 the city capitulated and its entire population was enslaved. This victory was followed by the capture of most of the Balearics' major settlements and the freeing of most captive Christians on the islands. The independent Muslim taifa ruler was taken back to Pisa a captive. The greatest victory, however, was the annihilation of Majorcan piracy.
The conquest of the Balearics lasted no more than a few months. In 1115 they were reconquered by the Almoravids of peninsular Iberia.# 11665 Dirichlet
11665 Dirichlet, provisional designation 1997 GL28, is a Griqua asteroid and a 2:1 Jupiter librator from the outermost regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 6.8 kilometers (4 miles) in diameter. It was discovered on 14 April 1997, by astronomer Paul Comba at the Prescott Observatory in Arizona, United States. The asteroid was named after German mathematician Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet.

## Orbit and classification
Dirichlet is a Griqua asteroid, a small dynamical group of asteroids located in the otherwise sparsely populated Hecuba gap (2:1 resonance with Jupiter), which is one of the largest Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.8–3.8 AU once every 5 years and 11 months (2,169 days; semi-major axis of 3.28 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.15 and an inclination of 16° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins prior to its official discovery observation with a precovery taken by Spacewatch in October 1994.

## Naming
This minor planet was named after German mathematician Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet (1805–1859), who was the successor of Carl Friedrich Gauss and the predecessor of Bernhard Riemann at the University of Göttingen. His contributions include the first rigorous proof that the Fourier series converges. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 23 November 1999 (M.P.C. 36951).

## Physical characteristics
According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Dirichlet measures 6.8 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.09. As of 2018, no rotational lightcurve of Dirichlet has been obtained from photometric observations. The body's rotation period, pole and shape remain unknown.
# 1159 Granada
1159 Granada, provisional designation 1929 RD, is a dark background asteroid and relatively slow rotator from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 30 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 2 September 1929, by astronomer Karl Reinmuth at the Heidelberg Observatory in southwest Germany. The asteroid was named for the Spanish city and province of Granada.

## Orbit and classification
Granada is a background asteroid that does not belong to any known asteroid family. It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 2.2–2.5 AU once every 3 years and 8 months (1,341 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.06 and an inclination of 13° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins nine days after its official discovery observation at Heidelberg.

## Physical characteristics
Although Granada is an assumed S-type asteroid, it has a notably low albedo (see below) for an asteroid of the inner main-belt, even below that of most carbonaceous asteroids.

### Slow rotation
In September 1984, a rotational lightcurve of Granada was obtained from photometric observations by astronomer Richard Binzel. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 31 hours with a brightness variation of 0.28 magnitude (U=2). In October 2010, photometric observations in the R-band by astronomers at the Palomar Transient Factory gave a period of 72.852 hours and an amplitude of 0.24 (U=2). While not being a slow rotator, Granada's period is significantly longer than the typical 2 to 20 hours measures for most asteroids.

### Diameter and albedo
According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Granada measures between 27.839 and 34.65 kilometers in diameter and its surface has a low albedo between 0.028 and 0.0471.
The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.0439 and a diameter of 29.94 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 11.63.

## Naming
This minor planet was named after Granada, city and province in Andalusia in southern. The official naming citation was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 (H 108).

# 120s
The 120s was a decade that ran from January 1, AD 120, to December 31, AD 129.
During this decade, the Roman Empire was ruled by Emperor Hadrian (r. 117–138). In the prior decade, he had succeeded Emperor Trajan, who had expanded the empire to its greatest extent. Hadrian, in contrast, adopted a more defensive foreign policy, focusing on consolidating the empire's borders and improving its infrastructure, such as Hadrian's Wall in Britain. There was almost a renewed war with Parthia, but the threat was averted when Hadrian succeeded in negotiating a peace in 123 (according to the Historia Augusta, disputed). Furthermore, Hadrian enacted, through the jurist Salvius Julianus, the first attempt to codify Roman law. This was the Perpetual Edict, according to which the legal actions of praetors became fixed statutes and, as such, could no longer be subjected to personal interpretation or change by any magistrate other than the Emperor.
The Chinese Eastern Han dynasty saw the death of regent Deng Sui in 121, after which Emperor An took on the reins of the imperial administration. In 121, there were again Qiang and Xianbei rebellions, which would continue to plague Emperor An for the rest of his reign.  The only border where there were Han accomplishments during Emperor An's reign was on the northwestern front—the Xiyu (modern Xinjiang and former Soviet central Asia)—where Ban Chao's son Ban Yong (班勇) was able to reestablish Han dominance over a number of kingdoms. Emperor An was succeeded by Marquess of Beixiang in 125, who reigned for a short time before being succeeded by Emperor Shun of Han that same year. At the start of Emperor Shun's reign, the people were hopeful that he would reform the political situation from the pervasive corruption under the Yans.  However, the teenage emperor proved to be a kind but weak ruler.  While he trusted certain honest officials, he also trusted many corrupt eunuchs, who quickly grabbed power.

# 12 Lacertae
12 Lacertae is a wide binary star system in the northern constellation of Lacerta, located roughly 1,260 light years away from the Sun based on parallax. It is visible to the naked eye as a dim, blue-white hued point of light with a baseline apparent visual magnitude of 5.23. The system is drifting closer to the Earth with a mean heliocentric radial velocity of –12.5. It is a probable member of the I Lacertae OB association (Lac OB1).
The primary component is a Beta Cephei variable with a stellar classification of B1.5III, matching a B-type star with the luminosity class of a giant star. It has been known to be variable for more than a century and has been extensively studied. The variable radial velocity of the star was discovered by W. S. Adams in 1912, and the light variations were established by 1919. The pulsational nature of the variability was shown by P. Ledoux in 1951, which led to one of the first world-wide observing campaigns with the star as its target. Dutch mathematician F. J. M. Barning analyzed the resulting data in 1963 and found four separate cycles of variation. By 1994, six periods had been confirmed.
The variable star designation of the primary is DD Lacertae, while 12 Lacertae is the Flamsteed designation. In general terms it varies in magnitude from 5.16 down to 5.28 with a period of 4.63 hours. As many as eleven different frequencies have been detected, with the dominant cycle showing a frequency of 5.179034 cycles per day. Curiously, three of the frequencies form an equally-spaced triplet with cycles of 5.179, 5.334, and 5.490 per day, although this alignment appears to be a coincidence. It is a hybrid pulsator, showing mixed behaviors of a Beta Cephei variable and a slowly pulsating B-type star.
The primary is a massive star, having 9.5 times the mass of the Sun and an age of only 22 million years old. It has about 8.4 times the girth of the Sun. The averaged quadratic field strength of the surface magnetic field is (2,352.3±1,604.9)×10−4 T. It is radiating 8,877 times the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 23,809 K. The estimated rotational velocity of the primary at the equator is 52±5 km/s; about 10% of its break-up velocity. However, seismic models suggest the core region is rotating much more rapidly with a rotational velocity of up to 100 km/s, and thus the star is undergoing differential rotation.

The meridian 141° west of Greenwich is a line of longitude that extends from the North Pole across the Arctic Ocean, North America, the Pacific Ocean, the Southern Ocean, and Antarctica to the South Pole.
The 141st meridian west forms a great circle with the 39th meridian east.
Most of the border between Alaska, United States and Yukon, Canada is defined by the meridian, meaning the western extremity of Canada lies on this meridian.

## From Pole to Pole
Starting at the North Pole and heading south to the South Pole, the 141st meridian west passes through:

# 174th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery
The 174th Field Regiment was a unit of Britain's Royal Artillery (RA) during the Second World War. Originally formed to man beach defence batteries, it was later converted to field artillery. It served in Home Forces and supplied trained gunners to the fighting fronts, but saw no active service. It was disbanded in 1943.

## 8th Defence Regiment
After the British Expeditionary Force was evacuated from Dunkirk and the United Kingdom was threatened with invasion, a crash programme of installing coastal artillery batteries was implemented in the summer of 1940.
Later, as the Home Defence strategy developed, the Royal Artillery formed a number of  'Defence Batteries' to deploy around the coastline for general beach defence. These were not part of the RA's Coast Artillery branch, nor were they included in the field forces under Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, but equipped with whatever old guns were available they freed up scarce field artillery from static beach defence for the mobile counter-attack forces. Most of these batteries were formed on 1 September 1940, and they were grouped into regiments from 4 October. 8th Defence Regiment was formed at Leven, East Riding of Yorkshire, with 930–934 Defence Batteries. On 15 March 1941 931 and 934 Defence Btys were  disbanded.

## 174th Field Regiment
By the beginning of 1942 the imminent threat of invasion had passed, the coast artillery batteries were fully established, and the RA required gunners for the field forces. The remaining Defence Regiments in the UK were disbanded or converted into field artillery. On 12 January 1942 8th Defence Rgt at Neswick Hall, Driffield, East Riding, was converted into 174th Field Regiment, and 930, 932 and 933 Defence Btys were designated A, B and C Btys. A, B and C Btys were redesignated P, Q and R on 11 March. At this period the establishment of a field regiment was three batteries, each of two troops of four 25-pounder guns.
On 25 July 1942 the regiment was assigned to 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division, which had recently been placed on a lower establishment as a home defence formation with no immediate prospect of overseas service. At the time the division was in Northern Command, moving at the beginning of 1943 to South Western District.
On 1 January 1943 the regiment's batteries were numbered as 159, 160 and 161 Field Btys. But on 9 January the batteries were mobilised as independent batteries and later posted to units in Middle East Forces as follows:
- 159 Field Bty – joined 32nd Field Rgt, converted to 32nd Heavy Rgt 18 September 1943[13][14][15]
- 160 Field Bty – joined 57th (Home Counties) Field Rgt 10 June 1943[16]
- 161 Field Bty – joined 121st (West Riding) Field Rgt 20 June 1943[17][18]

Regimental HQ (RHQ) of 174th Field Rgt remained without any batteries to command until 10 March when it was disbanded and the personnel used to reform RHQ of the disbanded 52nd (Bedfordshire Yeomanry) Heavy Rgt at Fleetwood in Lancashire, with new batteries formed from coast artillery personnel.

174 Phaedra is a sizable, rocky main belt asteroid that was discovered by Canadian-American astronomer James Craig Watson on September 2, 1877, and named after Phaedra, the tragic lovelorn queen in Greek mythology.
The asteroid is orbiting the Sun with a period of 4.84 years and an eccentricity of 0.14. Lightcurve data obtained from Phaedra indicates a rather irregular or elongated body. It has a cross-section size of ~35 km. Photometric observations of this asteroid at the Shadowbox Observatory in Carmel, Indiana, during 2009 gave a light curve with a period of 4.96 ± 0.01 hours. This is consistent with previous studies in 1977, 1988, and 2008. The asteroid's pole of rotation lies just 5–16° away from the plane of the ecliptic.

# 1820s in football
 


The following are events in the 1820s decade which are relevant to the development of football.

## Events

### 1820
- By this time, some form of order was beginning to be imposed on what had for centuries been a chaotic pastime played not so much by teams as by mobs. This form of football, known more politely as "folk football", was essentially a public holiday event, Shrove Tuesday being a traditional day for games across the country. The games were free-for-alls with no holds barred and extremely violent. As for kicking and handling of the ball, it is certain that both means of moving the ball towards the goals were in use.[1]
- The public schools (e.g., Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester) began to devise their own versions of football, rules of which were verbally agreed and handed down over many years until the first codifications in the 1840s.[2]


### 1823
- The traditional date of the William Webb Ellis legend. He was the Rugby School pupil who, it was said later, "with a fine disregard for the rules of football, took the ball in his hands and ran with it".[3] Even if the tale is true, the game was a version of folk football with rules that were verbally agreed by the Rugby School pupils. Such rules were always open to challenge and it may be that an incident like this occurred with the result that a dribbling game became primarily a handling one.[3]
- Evidence exists of local games being played within certain limits (field and team sizes) which were similar to modern football in that goalposts, either erected or simulated, were in use as targets. There is a reference to players in East Anglia using their jackets for goalposts.[4]


### 1824
- Foundation of the Foot-Ball Club, in Edinburgh, thought to have been the first club to have played football of any kind,  anywhere in the world. [5]


## Births
- 12 March 1820 – Albert Pell (d. 1907), an early influence on the rules of football.
- 18 May 1821 – Jem Mackie (d. 1867), an early influence on the rules of football.

# 1899 Hume colonial by-election


A by-election was held for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly electorate of The Hume on 10 September 1899 because William Lyne had been appointed Premier and Colonial Treasurer, forming the Lyne ministry. Until 1904, members appointed to a ministerial position were required to face a by-election. These were generally uncontested. Of the nine ministers appointed in the Lyne ministry, The Hume and Ashfield (Bernhard Wise) were the only electorates in which the by-election was contested.

# 1900 Michigan State Normal Normalites football team
The 1900 Michigan State Normal Normalites football team represented Michigan State Normal College (later renamed Eastern Michigan University) during the 1900 college football season.  The team compiled a record of 0–4, failed to score a point, and was outscored by a combined total of 81 to 0. Austin F. Jones was the team captain.
In early September 1900, Clayton Teetzel was hired as Michigan State Normal's director of athletics and football coach. Teetzel was 24 years old at the time of his hiring; he had played football for the University of Michigan from 1897 to 1899 before graduating with a law degree in 1900.
By October 2, 1900, the enrollment at Michigan State Normal had reached 750 students. Another 200 or 300 students were expected by the end of the week. The school's prominence in the ranks of teaching school's was advanced by the Journal of Pedagogy's 1900 move of its headquarters from Syracuse, New York, to Ypsilanti.

# 1903 County Championship
The 1903 County Championship was the 14th officially organised running of the County Championship, and ran from 4 May to 3 September 1903. Middlesex won their first championship title, ending Yorkshire's run of three successive titles. Sussex finished in second place for the second successive season.

## Table
- One point was awarded for a win, and one point was taken away for each loss. Final placings were decided by dividing the number of points earned by the number of completed matches (i.e. those that ended in a win or a loss), and multiplying by 100.

# 1914 Australian Senate election
The 5 September 1914 election was a double dissolution election which meant all 36 seats in the Senate were up for election, with each Australian states electing six members, with half to serve a six-year term and the rest to serve a three year term.  Terms were taken to have commenced on 1 July 1914. The Senate resolved that in each State the three senators who received the most votes would sit for a six-year term, finishing on 30 June 1920 while the other half would sit for a three-year term, finishing on 30 June 1917.
It was a landslide victory for the Labor Party, which won 31 seats and was the largest party by first preference votes in every state except South Australia. The opposition party, the Commonwealth Liberal Party, won just one seat, which was in South Australia, despite retaining four seats (two each in New South Wales and Tasmania). The Liberal Party lost three seats, one each in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, while Labor lost one seat in New South Wales. Every state except Western Australia and South Australia swung to Labor.

Sitting senator Gregor McGregor (Labor) had re-nominated but died after the close of nominations, leaving Labor with only 5 candidates. Electors were required to vote for 6 candidates or their vote would be invalid. If there was a large informal vote or if the surplus votes were equally distributed there was a risk of Labor losing more than one seat. Labor therefore asked its supporters to vote for John Shannon (Liberal).

# 1923 Portuguese presidential election
Presidential elections were held in Portugal on 6 August 1923. The Congress of the Republic elected the president in Lisbon instead of the Portuguese people. However the new president Manuel Teixeira Gomes was elected In absentia, meaning that he wasn't present during the election.
There were a total of five candidates. Manuel Teixeira Gomes won the election against his opponents and became the next President of the Republic.

# 1923 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours
The 1923 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours were a set of honours gazetted on 25 May 1923, five days after Bonar Law's resignation as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. At the time Bonar Law was seriously ill with cancer of the throat, and his honours list included two physicians who were involved in his care: Sir Thomas Horder and Dr Gould May.
The honours list was comparatively short; in addition to the above two physicians there were just four recipients: his private secretary, his parliamentary private secretary and his two principal private secretaries.

# 1923 Santos FC season
The 1923 season was the twelfth season for Santos FC.
# (277810) 2006 FV35
(277810) 2006 FV35, provisional designation 2006 FV35, is a sub-kilometer near-Earth asteroid in the dynamical Apollo asteroid group, discovered by Spacewatch at Kitt Peak National Observatory, Arizona, on 29 March 2006. It is a quasi-satellite of Earth. It is also notable for having a low delta-v requirement for rendezvous. Although its orbital period is almost exactly 1 year, the orbit of 2006 FV35 has a high eccentricity which causes it to cross the paths of both Venus and Mars.

## Transfer energy
With a semi-major axis of almost exactly 1 astronomical unit, 2006 FV35 has a relatively low transfer energy from Earth. The delta-v required to transfer to the asteroid varies between 11 and 13 km/s; this change in delta-v oscillates over an approximately 200-year period with the current transfer cost near its maximum of 13 km/s.
# (292220) 2006 SU49
(292220) 2006 SU49, provisional designation 2006 SU49, is a sub-kilometer asteroid, classified as near-Earth object and potentially hazardous asteroid of the Apollo group that had a small chance of impacting Earth in 2029.
It was discovered on 20 September 2006, by the Spacewatch project at the University of Arizona using the dedicated 0.9-meter telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory. The asteroid was calculated to measure 377 meters in diameter with a mass of 7.3×1010 kg.

## Description
2006 SU49 had a 1 in 42,000 chance of impacting Earth on 22 January 2029. By 29 October 2006, it was listed with a Torino Scale impact risk value of 0. It was removed from the Sentry Risk Table on 23 November 2006. It is now known that on 28 January 2029, the asteroid will be 0.00818 AU (1,224,000 km; 760,000 mi) from Earth.
It is a near-Earth asteroid that received minor attention in late September and early October 2006 because initial observations indicated a higher than usual probability that it would strike the Earth in 2029. However, the Near-Earth Object (NEO) Office at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) removed 2006 SU49 from its risk list as additional observations provided improved predictions that eliminated the possibility of an impact on Earth or the Moon through 2106. Similarly, NEODyS estimates show a zero impact probability through 2080.
2006 SU49 briefly led the Earth-impact hazard list from 27 September 2006 through 4 October 2006, temporarily displacing (144898) 2004 VD17 from the number one position. At the time, both held a Torino scale of level 1 and were the only asteroids to hold a Torino value greater than 0.
Even though 2006 SU49 has an Earth MOID of 0.0003 AU (45,000 km; 28,000 mi), the orbit and future close approaches are well determined with an orbital uncertainty of 0. It is also an Earth-crosser and Mars-crosser asteroid.
# 1927 Brunswick state election
The 1927 Brunswick state election was held on 27 November 1927 to elect the 48 members of the Landtag of the Free State of Brunswick.

# 1-2-3 (fuel station)
1-2-3 is an unmanned fuel station chain in the Nordic and Baltic regions.
It was created in 2000, as the low cost extension of the Statoil chain, and owned by Statoil Fuel & Retail ASA. The first outlet was opened in Kaunas in December 2000. 65 outlets were planned in the Baltic, later to be supplemented by 107 outlets in Norway and Denmark. Unlike the Statoil stations, there are no franchisees, and all stations are vertically integrated.
# 10.5 cm schwere Kanone 18/40
The 10.5 cm schwere Kanone 18/40 was a field gun used by Germany in World War II.  The 18/40 arose from an O.K.H request to produce a variant of the 10.5 cm schwere Kanone 18 with greater range.  Both Krupp and Rheinmetal produced similar, but competing designs.  Production was proposed in 1941, but delayed until 1943 because it was felt its introduction would disrupt existing production schedules.  When it did go into production it was designated as the 10.5 cm schwere Kanone 18/42.  The main difference between the schwere Kanone 18 and schwere Kanone 18/42 were a longer barrel and the same carriage as the 15 cm sFH 18/40.
# 10.5 cm leFH 16 Geschützwagen Mk VI 736 (e)
The 10.5 cm leFH 16 Geschützwagen Mk VI 736 (e) was a German self-propelled artillery piece. It was created by mounting the German 10.5 cm leFH 16 field howitzer onto the chassis of the British Light Tank Mk VI. The vehicle was created by engineer Alfred Becker, who was battery chief of the 12th Battery in the 15th Artillery Regiment, 227th Infantry Division. Becker found abandoned vehicles while his unit was performing coastal protection duties in France. He made use of his artillery crews to build this vehicle and a number of others to motorize his battery. Becker's unit operated the first purpose-built self-propelled artillery of the war. A previous rough-and-ready conversion, the 15 cm sIG 33 (Sf) auf Panzerkampfwagen I Ausf B, had merely put a sIG 33 inside a superstructure, complete with wheeled carriage.

## Construction
Following the German victory in France in July 1940, the 227th Infantry Division was assigned occupation, security, and coastal defense duties along the Normandy coast near Le Havre. There, Becker came across British armored vehicles that had been left behind. A mechanical engineer in civilian life, Becker considered the benefits that could be derived in mobility from mounting his artillery guns directly onto the chassis of the abandoned tanks. Becker's unit had been drawn from the Krefeld area. Krefeld was a manufacturing town, and many of the men who had been called up along with Becker were skilled workers in the iron processing industry. Recruiting the men of his battery and working by shift day and night, he set about his project.
The light but reliable British Mark VI Light Tank was selected by Becker for the chassis to mount the 10.5 cm howitzer on. The Mk VI's design made it suitable for use as artillery self-propelled guns, since the engine, transmission, steering assembly and drive wheels were all grouped together in the front of the chassis, leaving the rear of the vehicle available for the gun and the crew.
The superstructure and turret of the tank was removed. He then mounted the 10.5 cm leFH 16 howitzer just aft of the midpoint of the chassis. The location of the gun's mounting allowed the crew the room they needed to work the gun, and the commander was provided a better field of vision. To protect the crew, a metal housing was erected around the rear of the vehicle. Having worked at Deutsche Edelstahlwerke in Krefeld before the war, Becker was able to have them produce the plates he needed to form the shielding for the crew. He measured out the dimensions needed and had the plates manufactured and then shipped out to France. The steel plating ranged in thickness from 11 to 22 mm (0.43 to 0.87 in) The armour was too light to stop heavy shells or armour piercing rounds, but served to protect the crew from small arms fire and shrapnel fragments.
The crew compartment was small. The commander was positioned at the rear of the vehicle on the left. He had access to a range finding periscope which was mounted to the side of the vehicle. The gunner was directly in front of the commander. A gun sight extended above the shielding in front of him. The loader was on the right, and he had access to a tray of rounds stored behind the breech. In front of the loader sat the driver.
The vehicle was open topped. A machine gun could be mounted to the front of the shielding on the right. Though not intended for close combat, the crew had access to their personal weapons as well, which they could fire over the top of the fighting compartment if need be. A tarpaulin could be fitted to the top to give the crew some protection from the weather.
To provide stability when firing the relatively heavy gun from a rather light chassis, Becker used a lowered rear spur at rear to absorb the considerable recoil force. This recoil brake was made of a square steel frame reinforced with two cross bars. At the bottom were a pair of V-shaped "spades" which dug into the ground when firing.
The 10.5 cm leFH 16 main gun was a howitzer that had been first used by the German Army in World War I. Its maximum firing range was 9,225 m (10,089 yd), with a muzzle velocity of 395 metres per second (1,300 ft/s). The high explosive round was two-part; the high explosive shell would be loaded first followed by the cartridge propellant case. Depending on the range of the target, different sized bags of propellant were inserted into the cartridge.
Though an armour piercing round could be provided to the guns, the relatively low muzzle velocity gave it poor penetrative power. Used for direct-fire against armored vehicles, it could penetrate as much as 52 mm of armor plate at a range of 500 meters.
Over a six-month period Becker's unit succeeded in creating a complete battery, mobilizing twelve of the battalion's 10.5 cm leFH 16 howitzers. He also built six other vehicles mounting the larger 15 cm sFH 13 heavy guns, twelve munitions carrying versions of the Mk.VI, several munitions carrying versions of the Bren gun carrier and four armoured command tank versions of the Mk. VI.
Though awkward, the vehicle designation 10.5 cm LeFH 16 auf Geschützwagen Mk.VI(e) is descriptive. 10.5 cm LeFH 16 is the name of the gun mounted. auf Geschützwagen translates to 'on gun car'. Mk.VI refers to the Mk VI that is the chassis, and the letter 'e' for englisch that the vehicle was originally British manufacture. Some early images of the vehicles show the letters Gp followed by a number on the left side of the armor plate of the vehicle. Gp is an abbreviation for Geschützpanzer which translates as "gun tank" or "self-propelled gun", and the number indicates which one of those vehicles it is.

## Operational history
The battery's initial test firing was done at the range at Harfleur near Le Havre, France. The complete battery was tested at the training grounds at Beverloo, Belgium.
The vehicles saw their first use in combat when the 227th Infantry Division was transferred to Army Group North. In September 1941 the division was given orders to transfer from France to the east, and arrived there by rail later that autumn. The division took up positions in the forests south of Lake Ladoga as the German forces took up a defensive posture. The 227th was the only division on the Eastern Front to have a motorized artillery battery. When the 254th Infantry Division was under pressure and required extra artillery support, the 12th battery was temporarily transferred there. The fact that the battery could be moved easily and quickly made Becker's battery soon recognized as a ready, mobile force whose firepower could be quickly brought to bear. The battery was used to provide support to a variety of units through the next two months, however, when called upon to provide direct fire support for an infantry attack the battery suffered its first casualties. Four men, including Captain Becker, were wounded; their vehicles were small and lacked the heavy armour of an assault vehicle.
On 11 November 1941 a platoon of the battery was engaged with Soviet T-40 light tanks of the 2nd Tank Brigade. These light tanks mounted machine guns, but no heavy gun. A German battle report noted one of the self-propelled guns was hit 16 times, but its armor plate was not penetrated. The battery was again ordered to operate as assault guns on 15 November to support an attack of the 223rd Infantry Division. One of the vehicles was heavily damaged after running over a mine and three men were killed. The vehicle had to be left behind, but was recovered three days later.
The battery continued to conduct artillery fire support missions over the winter and spring of 1942. The battery's division, the 227th Infantry Division, continued to be engaged in fighting south of Lake Ladoga around the village of Pogost'ye. On 16 February 1942 the battery encountered KV-1 heavy tanks of the 124th tank battalion of the Soviet 54th Army. The 10.5 cm armour piercing ammunition used by the German gun crews was unable to knock out the KV-1s, and three of the 10.5 cm LeFH 16 auf Geschützwagen Mk.VI(e) self-propelled guns were destroyed.
In March 1942 three vehicles provided close support for troops moving along roads near Pogostyle. Over the next several months the self-propelled guns were gradually lost, most often by mine damage, but one was destroyed by direct fire from a tank of the 98th Tank Brigade. In August 1942 the OKH requested one of the Becker-designed vehicles be withdrawn and shipped to Berlin. On 2 September 1942 Becker and one of his crews presented the vehicle to Adolf Hitler and officers of the Army Ordnance Office in the garden of the Reich Chancellery. Following this meeting, Becker was withdrawn from the Eastern front and sent to France to build conversions using other captured or damaged vehicles.

## Further development
Becker had built the first German battery of purpose-built self-propelled artillery. This marked the start of a development that led to the creation of a separate mobilized artillery branch in the German army. This had been envisioned by Heinz Guderian as a component of the panzer division, but, apart from the Sturmpanzer I, such vehicles had not been developed thus far due to limitations in material and the priority on tank production. Subsequently, Germany produced self-propelled guns based on its own armored vehicle chassis, such as the Wespe using the Panzer II light tank and the Hummel based on the Panzer IV medium tank. The mobile artillery battery was a significant contribution to the further development of the panzer force. For his work on mobilizing the artillery pieces Becker was awarded the German Cross in Gold.# 1926 NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships
The 1926 NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships were contested as part of the third annual NCAA swim meet to determine the team and individual national champions of men's collegiate swimming and diving in the United States.
The championship was hosted by the United States Naval Academy at Scott Natatorium in Annapolis, Maryland.
Only individual championships were officially contested during the first thirteen-NCAA sponsored swimming and diving championships. Unofficial team standings were kept but a team title was not officially awarded until 1937.
Navy is acknowledged as this year's unofficial team champion, the second such title (and second consecutive) for the Midshipmen.

### Diameter and albedo
The asteroid was predicted to cross the focal plane array of the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS). However, it was missed on each of its seven planned observation and was never detected. According to the "missed predictions file" of the supplemental IRAS minor planet survey (SIMPS), the body was expected to have a diameter of 13.5 kilometers and an absolute magnitude of 13.20.
Based on an absolute magnitude of 13.99, and an assumed standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20, the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link calculated a much smaller diameter of 4.7 kilometers, which agrees with a diameter of 4.1 kilometers, found by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission.

### Rotation period
In October 2010, a rotational lightcurve for this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations at the Palomar Transient Factory in California. It rendered a tentative rotation period of 3.0706±0.0004 hours with a brightness variation of 0.08 in magnitude (U=1).
# 12th Tennessee Infantry Regiment
The 12th Regiment, Tennessee Infantry was an infantry regiment from Tennessee that served with the Confederate States Army in the American Civil War.

## Service
It was mustered in 1861, consisting mostly of men from Gibson County. Colonel Tyree Harris Bell was its commanding officer. Robert Porter Caldwell was the major for the regiment. The regiment fought in notable battles, including the Battle of Shiloh.
# 105th Siege Battery, Royal Garrison Artillery
105th Siege Battery was a unit of Britain's Royal Garrison Artillery formed during World War I. It served on both the Western Front, including the Battles of the Somme, Arras and Passchendaele, and the Italian Front, where it participated in the repulse of the Austrian Summer Offensive of 1918 and the crushing victory at Vittorio Veneto.

## Mobilisation and training
105th Siege Battery was formed at Fort Burgoyne, Dover, on 13 January 1916 under Army Council Instruction 145 of 19 January 1916 with the establishment for a battery of towed 12-inch Mark II Vickers Howitzers. Major C.E. Eady was in command. The battery was sent by rail to Horsham, and then to the artillery ranges at Lydd for training. Among the officers appointed to the battery was the artist and illustrator E. H. Shepard, commissioned as a Second lieutenant.

## Western Front
On 18 April the unit was ordered to change to the establishment for a battery of 8-inch howitzers. The battery proceeded to France on 17 May under the command of Captain P.B. Simon. The men travelled with complete stores but without guns. On arrival they were sent to Le Parcq near Hesdin where they were issued with four French 120 mm long guns, which were hated by the inexperienced gunners trained on howitzers.
The battery was under the command of XVII Corps' Heavy Artillery in Third Army and was assigned to 50th Heavy Artillery Group (HAG). After the officers and gun No 1s had undergone a short course on the unfamiliar 120mm, the battery first went into action on 10 June in front of Mont-Saint-Éloi near Arras, firing on enemy trenches at Vimy, where there had recently been heavy fighting. Captain Simon was invalided home on 29 June and Captain D'Arcy J. Richards, the battery captain, took over command as Acting Major.

### Somme
On 3 July the battery was transferred south to Fourth Army, which had just launched the Battle of the Somme. It joined 29th HAG the following day and spent 6 July digging in at Bronfay Farm, where the HAG's HQ was located. For the next 10 days it was firing on Owzentin, Trônes and Longueval during the Battle of Bazentin Ridge and the Capture of Trônes Wood in support of XIII Corps. On 16 July the battery moved forward to Maricourt Orchard, but had to be withdrawn following heavy casualties from High explosive (HE) and gas shells. Shortly afterwards the signals officer, 2nd Lt M.G. Herbert, and Corporal Dell won the Military Cross (MC) and Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM) respectively for their bravery in tackling a fire among live hand grenades at Maricourt Chateau.
On 23 July the battery moved to a fresh position behind 'Copse B' (Aromme Avenue), which had just been captured. Here it remained until September, although it was transferred to the command of 57th HAG on 14 August when XIV Corps took over that section of the front during the fighting for Delville Wood. The battery was relieved on 18 September and was issued with four modern British 6-inch howitzers. It moved up to positions near Guillemont and joined 28th HAG, with which it saw out the fighting on the Somme until November, including bombardments of the German third line at Morval, Lesbœufs and Le Transloy.
The battery moved forward to a position by Leuze Wood on 10 December and came under the direct command of Guards Division around Sailly-Saillisel and St Pierre Vaast Wood. It stayed in this position through the winter. On 19 February 1917 A/Maj Richards won an MC for maintaining communications during a trench raid conducted by the neighbouring French troops.

### Arras
After the German retirement to the Hindenburg Line (Operation Alberich), 105th Siege Bty was transferred to 73rd HAG in Third Army on 22 March in preparation for the forthcoming Arras Offensive. Right Section moved first, taking up position at Chat Maigre; Left Section joined a fortnight later. Despite the protection of the embankment of the Arras–Bapaume railway, the gun positions were very exposed and gun flashes from German-held Monchy-le-Preux were clearly visible. The battery had been carrying out daily bombardments on the Hindenburg Line in preparation for the attack when on 5 April a lorry delivering ammunition was hit by a German shell and left burning a few yards from No 4 gun. Major Richards called for volunteers and together with Lieutenant R.J.H. Hambly kept the gun firing until the lorry blew up a few minutes later, causing a dump of 200 HE shells to explode. The gun detachment was knocked down and the gun put out of action. Despite being badly shaken, Richards continued to direct the fire of the rest of the battery until the bombardment task was completed. Major Richards was awarded a Distinguished Service Order (DSO), Lt Hambly an MC, Cpls Wady and Evans DCMs, and Sergeants Griffiths and Black Military Medals (MM).
The Battle of Arras was launched on 9 April 1917 and the battery moved forward to Mercatel later that day. On the morning of 23 April, while the fighting near Arras continued, the battery was heavily shelled and Maj Richards and a number of others were seriously wounded. 2nd Lieutenant Shepard found himself in temporary command on the battery position. That evening he went back into the front line at the battery's observation post (OP) under heavy shell and machine gun fire. He was awarded the MC and promoted to A/Captain for that night's work. Captain L.F. Garratt was posted in to command the battery on 5 May. The battery moved to Hénin-sur-Cojeul on 9 May, and subsequently into the captured Hindenburg Support Line at Fontaine-lès-Croisilles.
105th Siege Bty remained with Third Army until the Arras offensive petered out in June, coming under the command of 46th HAG on 13 May, 39th HAG on 28 June and 59th HAG on 29 June. On 9 July it was transferred north to 67th HAG with First Army, arriving on 13 July. The sections were split between Cambrin and Vermelles in the Lens sector.
On 4 September the battery collected two extra howitzers, and on 22 September it was joined by a section from the newly-arrived 440th Siege Bty, bringing its personnel up to the establishment numbers for a six-gun battery. The men were moved to St Pierre-Lens where they were engaged in digging gun-pits at St Pierre-Lens in October for an operation that was cancelled.

### Ypres
The battery moved to the Ypres Salient on 29 October to join 6th HAG with VIII Corps. This was part of Second Army, which had taken over direction of the faltering Third Ypres Offensive and fought a series of successful battles employing massive weight of artillery. But as the offensive continued with the Battle of Poelcappelle and First and Second Battles of Passchendaele, the tables were turned: British batteries were clearly observable from the Passchendaele Ridge and were subjected to counter-battery (CB) fire, while their own guns sank into the mud and became difficult to move and fire. 105th Siege Bty came into action near Zillebeke. On 9 November the camouflage netting of No 1 gun caught fire, which was extinguished under enemy fire by Sgt Walton (who was awarded the MM). The following day (the last day of the battle), while carrying out barrage fire, No 2 gun blew up, killing or wounding the whole detachment. Next day after the battery reverted to a four-gun establishment and on 12 November it joined 24th HAG.

## Italian Front
The battery was expecting some home leave after the Ypres Offensive, but following the disastrous Battle of Caporetto on the Italian Front, Second Army HQ and several of its sub-formations were sent to reinforce the Italian Army. 24th HAG left with XIV Corps on 17 November 1917, travelling via Paris, Marseille and Genoa, arriving at Verona on 25 November. By 6 December its guns went into action on the Montello Hill, supporting the Italian army, which had been critically short of heavy artillery. The situation was stabilised by the end of the year, but XIV Corps and 24th HAG remained in Italy.
Apart from some CB shoots, there was little activity through the winter months. In February 1918 the HAGs became permanent RGA brigades: 24th Bde consisted of one heavy battery (1/1st Warwickshire Bty) and three other 6-inch howitzer siege batteries (172nd, 229th and 247th) in addition to the 105th.

### Piave
At the end of March 1918, 105th Siege Bty moved to a position south of the Asiago plateau supporting VIII Italian Corps. The gunsites were in wooded mountainous terrain and the guns had to be manhandled into position. They carried out trench bombardment while awaiting the next Austrian offensive (the Second Battle of the Piave River). This finally came on 15 June. Despite some initial Austrian gains, 48th (South Midland) Division held its main positions. The battery was at Monte Torle and was heavily engaged all day. Gunner Stubbs was awarded the MM and Gnr Taylor the Italian Silver Medal of Military Valor for keeping communications open during the day. The British heavy howitzers systematically destroyed the Austrian guns on the Asiago, notwithstanding poor visibility early on (Royal Air Force observation aircraft were able to direct the fire later) and the Austrian offensive failed all along the front.

### Vittorio Veneto
Preparations then began for the final battle on the Italian Front, the stunning success of the Battle of Vittorio Veneto. The British were relieved in the Asiago sector and moved to join the British-commanded Tenth Italian Army near Treviso. 24th HAG supported a number of British and French raids during September and October, then on 23 October the preliminary attacks began, supported by 24th HAG's howitzers. The main British assault crossed the River Piave on 27 October, with the heavy guns engaging all known Austrian gun positions and providing a protective barrage on either flank. A bridge was ready by 29 October and the heavy guns crossed the river. By 1 November the Austrian army had collapsed and the pursuing British troops had left their heavy guns far in the rear. Austrian signed the Armistice of Villa Giusti on 3 November, ending the war in Italy.
After the Armistice, 24th HAG was involved in securing prisoners. Shepard was promoted to Major in command of the battery, and given the duty of administering captured enemy guns. Demobilisation of the batteries in Italy began at Christmas 1918 and by March  105th Siege Bty was down to cadre strength. It handed in its guns and proceeded to Le Havre, where was disbanded on 30 March 1919.

10th Tactical Squadron (known as 10.ELT - 10 Eskadra Lotnictwa Taktycznego in Poland) is a fighter squadron of Polish Air Force established in 2008 in Łask, Poland. The squadron is stationed at 32nd Air Base and since 1 October 2008 operates the F-16 C/D Block 52+ Adv.
In March 2012 the squadron deployed to Israeli Air Force base Ovda for a two-week-long joint exercise with Israel's 115, 117 and 106 squadrons.
# 135th Armored Cavalry Division "Ariete"
The 135th Armored Cavalry Division "Ariete" (Italian: 135ª Divisione cavalleria corazzata "Ariete", colloquially also known as "135th Armored Division "Ariete II") was an armored division of the Royal Italian Army during World War II. It was formed in 1943 and named to commemorate the 132nd Armored Division "Ariete", which had distinguished itself during the Western Desert campaign and was destroyed during the Second Battle of El Alamein. After the announcement of the Armistice of Cassibile on 8 September 1943 the division fought the invading German forces South of Rome. After two days the division was forced to surrender and was disbanded by the Germans on 12 September 1943.

## History
The 132nd Armored Division "Ariete" had been formed in Milan in February 1939 and been sent to Libya in 1941. The division participated in all battles of the Western Desert campaign until it fought to annihilation during the Second Battle of El Alamein. On 21 November 1942 the remnants of the 132nd Armored Division "Ariete" were combined with the remnants of the 133rd Armored Division "Littorio" and 101st Motorized Division "Trieste" as Tactical Group "Ariete". The Tactical Group fought a successful rearguard action at El Agheila, but was soon afterwards disbanded. On 8 December 1942 the Ariete division was officially declared lost.
On 1 April 1943 the 135th Armored Cavalry Division "Ariete" was activated in Ferrara. The division was made up of cavalry regiments and General Raffaele Cadorna, the commander of the army's Cavalry Application School, became the division's first (and only) commander. The division remained in the Emilia region until it moved to Rome in August 1943 in the wake of the fall of the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini on 26 July 1943.
The division was assigned to the Motorized-Armored Army Corps and tasked with defense of the northern approaches to Rome on both sides of Lake Bracciano in the towns of Monterosi and Manziana. On 8 September 1943, when the Armistice of Cassibile was announced, the division's strength was 8,500 men, with 176 working tanks and armored vehicles, about 70 cannons and 92 20mm anti-aircraft guns.
On 9 September 1943 the division successfully blocked the advance of the German 3rd Panzergrenadier Division and elements of the 26th Panzer Division. In Monterosi the German vanguard was blocked by the division's mixed engineer battalion, which was supported by the Regiment "Cavalleggeri di Lucca" and the III Group of the 135th Artillery Regiment with 149/19 Mod. 37 howitzers. After the flight of the Italian King Victor Emmanuel III and his government from Rome the division was ordered on 10 September to move to Tivoli and abandon the defense of Rome. Cadorna did as ordered, but dispatched the lancers of the Regiment "Lancieri di Montebello" to the South of Rome to assist the 12th Infantry Division "Sassari" and 21st Infantry Division "Granatieri di Sardegna" in the defense of the city. The lancers under General Dardano Fenulli arrived in time to fight in the Battle of Porta Pia against the German 2. Fallschirmjäger-Division. In the late afternoon the Italian units defending Rome were told that an agreement with the Germans had been reached and ordered to surrender.
The next day, on 11 September 1943, the division's commander General Cadorna went into hiding and joined the resistance in Rome, the Clandestine Military Front of Colonel Giuseppe Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo. On 12 September 1943 the 135th Armored Cavalry Division "Ariete" was officially dissolved.

# "Leptura" longipennis
"Leptura" longipennis is an extinct species of longhorn beetle that lived in the Oligocene of Germany. It was first described by Georg Statz in 1938, from a fossil of two elytra and a leg found in the Rott Formation. It was originally described as a species of the genus Leptura, but later research has determined it does not belong to that genus, and that it has an uncertain placement in the Lepturinae subfamily.
# 1114 Lorraine
1114 Lorraine, provisional designation 1928 WA, is a very dark background asteroid from the outer regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 70 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Alexandre Schaumasse at Nice Observatory in 1928, and named for the French region of Lorraine.

## Discovery
Lorraine was discovered on 17 November 1928, by French astronomer Alexandre Schaumasse at the Nice Observatory in southeastern France. On the following night, it was independently discovered by Italian astronomer Luigi Volta at the Observatory of Turin, Italy. The Minor Planet Center recognizes only the first discoverer. The asteroid was first observed as A906 UE at Heidelberg Observatory in October 1906.

## Orbit and classification
Lorraine is a non-family asteroid from the main belt's background population (Nesvorny). Conversely, the asteroid is also considered a core member of the Eos family (Novakovic, Knezevic and Milani). It orbits the Sun in the outer asteroid belt at a distance of 2.9–3.3 AU once every 5 years and 5 months (1,989 days; semi-major axis of 3.10 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.07 and an inclination of 11° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Nice Observatory in November 1928, one night after its official discovery observation.

## Physical characteristics
In the SMASS classification, Lorraine is an Xc-subtype, transiting from the X-type to the C-type asteroids.

### Rotation period
In January 2005, a rotational lightcurve of Lorraine was obtained from photometric observations by French amateur astronomer Laurent Bernasconi. Analysis of the fragmentary lightcurve gave a longer-than-average rotation period of 32 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.16 magnitude (U=1). As of 2018, no secure period has been obtained.

### Diameter and albedo
According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Lorraine measures between 62.20 and 80.30 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.03 and 0.0501.
The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.0457 and a diameter of 62.15 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 10.0.

## Naming
This minor planet was named after the region of Lorraine, the former Duchy of Lorraine in north-eastern France, and a remnant of the medieval kingdom of Lotharingia (AN 238;149).
# 1420 Caldera earthquake
The 1420 Caldera earthquake was a pre-Columbian earthquake that shook the southern portion of Atacama Desert in the early morning of 31 August 1420 and caused tsunamis in Chile as well as Hawaii and the towns of Japan. The earthquake is thought to have had a size of 8.8–9.4 Mw. Historical records of the tsunami exist for the Japanese harbours of Kawarago and Aiga where confused residents saw the water recede in the morning of 1 September, without any sign of an earthquake. In Chile, rockfalls occurred along the coast as well, producing blocks of up to 40 tons that are now found inland. This is also consistent with the identification of a possible tsunami deposit in Mejillones Bay that has been dated to the range 1409 to 1449. Deposits found by coring of recent sediments in a wetland near Tongoy Bay have also been linked to the 1420 tsunami.
# (Ha Ha) Slow Down
"(Ha Ha) Slow Down" is the first single from Fat Joe's tenth studio album The Darkside Vol. 1. The song features rapper Young Jeezy. It also contains a short sample of Soul II Soul's "Back to Life (However Do You Want Me)" (a capella version)  throughout the entire beat.

## Remixes
Several rappers have recorded freestyles over the song's instrumental, including The Lox, Talib Kweli, Shyne, Jae Millz, Game, Rick Ross, Nipsey Hussle, Capone-N-Noreaga, Raekwon, Uncle Murda, Jim Jones, Rayne Storm and French Montana. More elements of "Back to Life (However Do You Want Me)" are sampled on Maino's version.

## Music video
The music video was produced by Parris and features a cameo by Diddy, Trina, Waah (Ruff Ryders Entertainment CEO) & Al Harrington (professional NBA player from the Denver Nuggets).

# 1113 Katja
1113 Katja, provisional designation 1928 QC, is a background asteroid from the outer regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 39 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Pelageya Shajn at the Simeiz Observatory in 1928, and named after Ekaterina Iosko, a staff member at the discovering observatory.

## Discovery
Katja was discovered on 15 August 1928, by Soviet astronomer Pelageya Shajn at the Simeiz Observatory on the Crimean peninsula. Nine nights later, it was independently discovered by Max Wolf at the German Heidelberg Observatory on 24 August 1928. The Minor Planet Center only recognizes the first discoverer. The asteroid was first observed as A909 DH at Heidelberg in February 1909.

## Orbit and classification
Katja is a non-family asteroid of the main belt's background population. It orbits the Sun in the outer asteroid belt at a distance of 2.7–3.6 AU once every 5 years and 6 months (2,004 days; semi-major axis of 3.11 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.14 and an inclination of 13° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Heidelberg, 10 days after its official discovery observation at Simeiz.

## Physical characteristics
Although Katja is an assumed, carbonaceous C-type asteroid, it is rather of stony composition due to its high albedo.

### Rotation period
Between 2002 and 2011, several rotational lightcurves of Katja were obtained from photometric observations by French amateur astronomers Maurice Audejean, René Roy and Laurent Brunetto (U=2/2/2-). Best rated lightcurve, however, was obtained at the Sunflower (739), Blackberry (929) and Universidad de Monterrey (720) observatories in January 2002. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined synodic rotation period of 18.465 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.17 magnitude (U=3).

### Diameter and albedo
According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Katja measures between 38.20 and 51.949 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.1144 and 0.211.
The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.2253 and a diameter of 38.65 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 9.3.

## Naming
This minor planet was named for Ekaterina ("Katja") Iosko, a laboratory assistant and orbit calculator at the discovering Simeiz Observatory (AN 238, 149). She was the daughter of Iosif Gavrilovich Iosko, who also worked as a mechanician at the observatory.
# 1933–34 Gauliga Bayern
The 1933–34 Gauliga Bayern was the inaugural season of the league, one of the 16 Gauligas in Germany at the time. It was the first tier of the football league system in Bavaria (German:Bayern) from 1933 to 1945. The Gauliga Bayern had replaced the Bezirksliga Bayern which had been played in two divisions, north and south, as the top tier of football in Bavaria at the end of the 1932–33 seasons.
The Gauligas in Germany replaced the seven regional championships and a large number of local leagues that existed in Germany until then and were established after the rise of the Nazis to power in 1933.
The league champions 1. FC Nürnberg qualified for the 1934 German football championship, where it finished first in its group with Dresdner SC, Borussia Fulda and Wacker Halle and qualified for the semi-finals. After defeating Viktoria 89 Berlin 2–1 Nürnberg advanced to the final where it lost 2–1 to FC Schalke 04. For 1. FC Nürnberg it was the seventh time the club reached the final and the first time it lost, having won five national championships from 1920 to 1927 and also participated in the inconclusive 1922 final. For Nürnberg it was the first of seven Gauliga championships the club would win in the era from 1933 to 1944.
After attempts to establish professionalism in German football in 1932 the rise of the Nazis to power put a sudden end to this, forcing all football leagues in Germany, including the Gauligas, to remain strictly amateur. The new political situation in Germany at the time of the introduction of the Gauligas, the Nazis having come to power, also meant that Jewish players and officials were no longer permitted to take part in German sport clubs. For Gauliga clubs like FC Bayern Munich, taunted as Judenklub, this meant it lost important figures that had built the club up to win its first German championship in 1932. After president Kurt Landauer and coach Richard Dombi had to leave the club because of their Jewish background, the club declined.

Humphrey Cook, age 13 of Virginia, took second after misspelling homogeneity. 14-year-old Mildred Kariher of Ohio took third after missing farcial [sic].
There were 21 contestants this year, all in the fifth through eight grades, with the westernmost entrant from Colorado.
A banquet was held the night before the Bee at the Ambassador Hotel. The winner of the first bee in 1925, Frank Neuhauser, now a law student, was in attendance.
The first place prize was $500, second was $300, and third was $100. Fourth through 16th place received $50, and 17th through 21st received $40. Winner Rice (married name Riza) later worked as an office manager and business manager until retiring in 1996. She took up running in her 50s and ran the Boston Marathon three times.

# 1166 Sakuntala
1166 Sakuntala, provisional designation 1930 MA, is a stony background asteroid from the central regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 26 kilometers in diameter. Discovered by Praskovjya Parchomenko at Simeiz Observatory in 1930, the asteroid was named after the figure of Shakuntala from an ancient Indian drama.

## Discovery
Sakuntala was discovered by Soviet astronomer Praskovjya Parchomenko at the Simeiz Observatory on the Crimean peninsula on 27 June 1930. Two night later, it was independently discovered by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at Heidelberg Observatory. The body's observation arc begins at Uccle Observatory in May 1938, or 8 years after its official discovery observation at Simeiz.

## Orbit and classification
The asteroid is a background asteroid, that is not a member of any known asteroid family. Sakuntala orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.0–3.1 AU once every 4.04 years (1,474 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.21 and an inclination of 19° with respect to the ecliptic.

## Physical characteristics
Sakuntala has been characterized as a stony S-type asteroid.

### Rotation period
Several rotational lightcurves of Sakuntala were obtained from photometric observations. Analysis of the best-rated lightcurve gave a rotation period of 6.29 hours with a brightness variation of 0.38 magnitude (U=3).
Other measurements gave a similar period of 6.2915 and 6.30 hours, respectively (U=3-/2), while lightcurves with a period of larger than 20 hours are considered to be wrong (U=1/1/1).

### Diameter and albedo
According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Sakuntala measures between 22.70 and 29.249 kilometers in diameter  and its surface has an albedo between 0.185 and 0.6460.
The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.2914 and  a diameter of 25.78 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 9.9.

## Naming
This minor planet was named after the protagonist Shakuntala in the Sanskrit drama The Recognition of Shakuntala by Indian poet Kālidāsa. The drama is part of the Mahabharata, one of the major Sanskrit epics of ancient India.
The official naming citation was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 (H 108).

# 1159 papal election
The papal election held from 4 to 7 September 1159 following the death of Pope Adrian IV resulted in the election of two rival popes. A majority of the cardinals elected Cardinal Rolando of Siena as Pope Alexander III, but a minority refused to recognize him and elected their own candidate, Ottaviano de Monticelli, who took the name Victor IV, creating a schism that lasted until 1178.
The schism was a result of the growing tensions inside the Sacred College of Cardinals concerning the foreign policy of the Holy See. The Papal States in the 12th century were a buffer between the Holy Roman Empire and the Norman Kingdom of Sicily. After the Concordat of Worms in 1122, the Papacy allied with the Empire rather than with the Normans, but during the pontificate of Adrian IV (1154–59) this alliance broke up because Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa did not fulfil the terms of the treaty of Constance (1153) that obliged him to help the Papacy to restore its authority in Rome and in other territories controlled by the king of Sicily. In these circumstances Adrian IV decided to break the alliance with the Emperor and to make peace with William I of Sicily by signing the Treaty of Benevento (1156). In the following years there were growing tensions between the papacy and Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa (e.g. a dispute at the diet of Besançon in 1157). Frederick tried – with significant success – to strengthen his influence on the Church in Germany. The change of direction of the papal foreign policy resulted in the division of the Sacred College into supporters and opponents of the new policy, who were unable to achieve a compromise after the death of Adrian IV.
The election of 1159 had also significant legal consequences. Up to that time, the election of the new pope required unanimity among the electors, which led to the schism when the existence of factions in the Sacred College made the unanimity impossible. To avoid such schism in the future, the Third Lateran Council in 1179 promulgated the decree Licet de evitanda discordia, which established the rule that the Pope is elected with a majority of two thirds of the cardinals participating in the election.

## Death of Adrian IV
Pope Adrian IV died on 1 September 1159. Fearing a possible schism, shortly before his death he recommended to the cardinals the election of Cardinal Bernard of Porto as his successor.

## List of participants
There were thirty-one cardinals in September 1159. One of them seems not to have participated in the election, leaving thirty electors:

## Divisions in the Sacred College
The College of Cardinals was divided into two factions: the so-called "Sicilian" party and the Imperial faction. The "Sicilian" party, led by chancellor Rolando of Siena and Camerlengo Boso, supported the pro-Sicilian policy of Adrian IV. The Imperial faction was led by Ottaviano of S. Cecilia.
It is known that the "Sicilian" party counted thirteen cardinals. They were chancellor Roland of S. Marco, camerlengo Boso of SS. Cosma e Damiano, cardinal-bishops Bernard of Porto, Ubaldo of Ostia, Walter of Albano and Gregorio of Sabina, as well as cardinals Odone of S. Giorgio, Ubaldo of S. Croce, Ottone of S. Nicola, Ardicio of S. Teodoro, Giovanni of S. Anastasia, Ildebrando of SS. Apostoli and Pietro of S. Eustachio.
The Imperial party may have counted as many as nine cardinals, but only six can be identified as its members: Ottaviano of S. Cecilia, Giovanni of SS. Silvestro e Martino, Guido of S. Maria in Trastevere, Imar of Tusculum, Raymond of S. Maria in Via Lata and Simeone of S. Maria in Domnica Guglielmo of S. Pietro in Vincoli was probably the seventh one. Perhaps Cardinal Cinzio of S. Adriano also belonged to this faction. The remaining ten cardinals were neutral.
It is believed that both factions made some preparations to the election in the last months of the pontificate of Adrian IV, although these attempts are known only from the hostile accounts produced for the polemical purposes during the subsequent schism and it is impossible to verify their accuracy. Both sides accused each other of illegal conspiracies. The adherents of Victor IV accused "Sicilians" of receiving the bribes from the king William I of Sicily and the anti-Imperial cities of Brescia, Milan and Piacenza. They ostensibly made an oath not to vote for any candidate outside their circle. On the other hand, "Sicilians" accused imperialists of hatching a plot with the imperial envoy Otto von Wittelsbach, who was present at Rome at the time of the election and gave the significant support to Victor IV in taking control over the Patrimony of St. Peter. It is known that the secular adherents of Cardinal Ottaviano de Monticelli, who was related to the powerful family of the counts of Tusculum, were prepared for the armed confrontation in Rome. Evidently, neither party was prepared for compromise.

## Proceedings

### Election of Alexander III
The cardinals assembled in the Vatican Basilica on 4 September, three days after the death of Adrian IV. They had decided that, according to the custom, the election should be unanimous to be valid. It seems that the candidature of Bernard of Porto, recommended by Adrian as acceptable for both factions, had never been even advanced. Both parties put forward candidates mutually unacceptable: the imperial party proposed Ottaviano de Monticelli, while "Sicilians" proposed chancellor Rolando. The cardinals discussed for three days without achieving a compromise. However, the "Sicilian" party was able to join all the neutral cardinals and probably detached also some members of the imperial faction. On the fourth day (7 September), Cardinal Rolando of Siena was proclaimed pope by them and took the name Alexander III, although the unanimity had not been achieved and some cardinals still opposed his candidature. According to the manifest of Alexandrine party of October 1159 and an account of Cardinal Boso, on that day Rolando received the votes of all cardinals assembled except three: those of Ottaviano of S. Cecilia, Giovanni of SS. Silvestro e Martino and Guido of S. Maria in Trastevere. Then supporters of Rolando recognized that “It seemed inappropriate that ... the apostolic see ... should remain any longer without a ruler because of the contentiousness of the aforesaid [three] men”. On the other hand, the opposite party claimed that Ottaviano had still nine votes, and that the "Sicilian" party, having majority, simply broke the rule that required unanimity for the valid election. However, the version of the imperial cardinals is believed to be less reliable than the version of the Alexandrine party, even if the latter may be also not fully accurate; based on the subscriptions of the manifests of both parties issued shortly after the election, it is possible to assume that at least twenty-three electors voted for Rolando, and no more than six opposed him.

### Election of Victor IV
The electors of Cardinal Rolando, immediately after proclaiming him Pope, attempted to place upon him the purple mantle which symbolized the assumption of the papal office, but then the election entered the tumultuous stage. Cardinal Ottaviano Monticelli snatched the mantle from Alexander's back and his armed bands burst into the basilica. Alexander III and his supporters fled to the citadel of St. Peter, which was in the hands of Cardinal Boso. In their absence, the few cardinals who remained in basilica elected Ottaviano of S. Cecilia to the papacy and enthroned him as Victor IV. The exact number of his electors is not known, but there are good reasons to believe that it was six, including Ottaviano himself, since only five cardinals signed the manifest in his favour in the following month. However, it is possible that some additional cardinals participated in the election of Victor IV but very quickly joined the obedience of Alexander III.

### Consecration of Alexander III
Pope Alexander III remained in the citadel for a week until he was rescued and escorted from Rome by Odo Frangipane, and on September 18 he was eventually bestowed with the purple mantle. On 20 September at the small village of Ninfa, south-east of Velletri, he was consecrated bishop of Rome by Cardinal Ubaldo Allucingoli, bishop of Ostia e Velletri, and crowned by Cardinal Odone Bonecase, protodeacon of S. Giorgio in Velabro. On 27 September he excommunicated Victor IV and his adherents.

### Consecration of Victor IV
Victor IV was consecrated on 4 October in the abbey of Farfa by Cardinal-Bishop Imar of Tusculum, dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals, assisted by the bishops Ubaldo of Ferentino and Riccardo of Melfi. With the armed assistance of Otto von Wittelsbach and his own armed groups in relatively short time he took control over the City of Rome and the Patrimony of St. Peter, while Alexander III took refuge in the territory of the Kingdom of Sicily, and later in France.

### Manifests of both factions in October 1159
Both rivals together with their adherents defended the legality of their elections. In October 1159 cardinals of both obediences produced the manifests to the Emperor Frederick in favour of their elects. The “Alexandrine” manifest was subscribed by twenty three cardinals, while that of Victorine faction only by five. Supporters of Victor IV, admitting that they were in minority, justified their action by the fact that the opposite faction broke the rule of unanimity and – in consequence – the election of Rolando was invalid. The opposite party claimed that the principle of unanimity had been breached by the obstructive conduct of merely three cardinals of the Imperial faction, who stubbornly refused to recognize the candidate desired by the rest of the Sacred College.

Simeone Borelli joined the obedience of Alexander III already at the end of 1159. Raymond of S. Maria in Vi Lata did the same between February and April 1160. Besides, at the end of 1159 Victor IV created at least three new cardinal-deacons: Bernard of SS. Sergio e Bacco, Giovanni of S Maria in Aquiro and Lando of S. Angelo, while Alexander III appointed on February 18, 1160, cardinal-deacon Milo of S. Maria in Aquiro.

## Schism
Both popes sent their legates to the Catholic kingdoms in order to secure their recognition. At the council of Pavia in February 1160 Emperor Frederick I declared himself in favour of Victor IV, and the episcopate of the Empire followed him, with the significant exception of archbishop of Salzburg Eberhard I von Hilpolstein-Biburg and his suffragans. King Valdemar I of Denmark also gave his support to Victor IV, but the primate of Denmark archbishop Eskil of Lund became partisan of Alexander III. It seems that Poland also supported Victor IV. The rest of Europe, namely France, England, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Scotland, Hungary, Sicily and the Latin territories in Outremer, recognized Alexander III as true Pope, even if in some of these countries there were a significant Victorine minorities in episcopates or among feudal rulers. The papal schism in Europe was now a fact.
The unity of the Church had been restored only after eighteen years, when Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa and Pope Alexander III signed a Treaty of Venice (1 August 1177); shortly thereafter the pro-imperial pope Callistus III (successor of Victor IV) abandoned his claims to the papacy and submitted to Alexander III (29 August 1178). Victor IV and his successors Paschal III (1164–68) and Callistus III (1168–78) are now regarded as antipopes by the Catholic Church, while Alexander III is recognized as legitimate successor of St. Peter the Apostle.

## Aftermath
The election of 1159 and the subsequent schism showed the necessity of amending the rules concerning papal elections. The decree Licet de evitanda discordia issued by the Third Lateran Council in 1179 abolished the rule of unanimity in favour of the rule of the majority of two thirds. The decree confirmed also that all three orders of the College of Cardinals (bishops, priests and deacons) are equal in the papal elections. Although the practice allowing the participation of cardinal-priests and cardinal-deacons on equal rights with cardinal-bishops had been introduced no later than in the papal election, 1118, the decree In Nomine Domini (1059) conferring the special electoral rights on the cardinal-bishops had never been formally revoked up to that time.

# 161st Street–Yankee Stadium station
The 161st Street–Yankee Stadium station is a New York City Subway station complex shared by the elevated IRT Jerome Avenue Line and the underground IND Concourse Line. It is located at the intersection of 161st Street and River Avenue in the Highbridge and Concourse neighborhoods of the Bronx. It is generally served by the 4 train at all times; the D train at all times except rush hours in the peak direction (unless there is an event at Yankee Stadium, and in such event, express trains will stop); and the B train weekdays until evening.
The combined passenger count for 161st Street–Yankee Stadium station in 2019 was 8,254,928, making it the busiest station in the Bronx and 49th busiest overall. This station is one of only two station complexes in the Bronx (the other being 149th Street–Grand Concourse).

## History

### Construction and opening

#### IRT Jerome Avenue Line
The Dual Contracts, which were signed on March 19, 1913, were contracts for the construction and/or rehabilitation and operation of rapid transit lines in the City of New York. The contracts were "dual" in that they were signed between the City and two separate private companies (the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company), all working together to make the construction of the Dual Contracts possible. The Dual Contracts promised the construction of several lines in the Bronx. As part of Contract 3, the IRT agreed to build an elevated line along Jerome Avenue in the Bronx.
161st Street station opened as part of the initial section of the line to Kingsbridge Road on June 2, 1917. Service was initially operated as a shuttle between Kingsbridge Road and 149th Street.
On July 1, 1918, trains on the Ninth Avenue El began stopping here, as they were extended from 155th Street, entering the Bronx via the Putnam Bridge, a now-demolished swing bridge immediately north of the Macombs Dam Bridge, to connect with the Jerome Avenue line between 161st Street and 167th Street.
Through service to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line began on July 17, 1918. The line was completed with a final extension to Woodlawn on April 15, 1918. This section was initially served by shuttle service, with passengers transferring at this station. The construction of the line encouraged development along Jerome Avenue, and led to the growth of the surrounding communities. The city government took over the IRT's operations on June 12, 1940.

#### IND Concourse Line
The IND Concourse Line, also referred to as the Bronx−Concourse Line, was one of the original lines of the city-owned Independent Subway System (IND). The line running from Bedford Park Boulevard to the IND Eighth Avenue Line in Manhattan was approved by the New York City Board of Transportation on March 10, 1925, with the connection between the two lines approved on March 24, 1927. The line was originally intended to be four tracks, rather than three tracks, to Bedford Park Boulevard.
Construction of the line began in July 1928. The building of the line and proposed extensions to central and eastern Bronx (see below) led to real estate booms in the area. The entire Concourse Line, including 161st Street—River Avenue station, opened on July 1, 1933, less than ten months after the IND's first line, the IND Eighth Avenue Line, opened for service. Initial service was provided by the C train, at that time an express train, between 205th Street, then via the Eighth Avenue Line, Cranberry Street Tunnel and the IND South Brooklyn Line (now Culver Line) to Bergen Street. The CC provided local service between Bedford Park Boulevard and Hudson Terminal (now World Trade Center).
On December 15, 1940, with the opening of the IND Sixth Avenue Line, the D train began serving the IND Concourse Line along with the C and CC. It made express stops in peak during rush hours and Saturdays and local stops at all other times. C express service was discontinued in 1949–51, but the C designation was reinstated in 1985 when double letters used to indicate local service was discontinued. During this time, the D made local stops along the Concourse Line at all times except rush hours, when the C ran local to Bedford Park Boulevard. On March 1, 1998, the B train replaced the C as the rush-hour local on the Concourse Line, with the C moving to the Washington Heights portion of the Eighth Avenue Line.
When the IND portion was built in 1933, paper tickets were used to transfer between the two lines; this method was used until the 1950s, when the indoor escalators were built.

### Station renovations
Elevators at the station were installed in the early 2000s as part of a three-year renovation of the station complex and opened in late 2002, making the station the fourth in the Bronx to be fully ADA-compliant.
The MTA announced in late 2022 that it would open customer service centers at 15 stations; the centers would provide services such as travel information and OMNY farecards. The first six customer service centers, including one at the 161st Street–Yankee Stadium station, were to open in early 2023. The 161st Street–Yankee Stadium station's customer service center opened in February 2023.

The station complex is ADA-accessible, with elevators available to all platforms.
This station is located adjacent to Yankee Stadium, and also provides service to many Bronx County courts, government facilities, and shopping districts in Concourse Village, which are a short walk to the east. The station is three blocks away from the Yankees–East 153rd Street station, a Metro-North Railroad stop on the Hudson Line, which provides service to Yankee Stadium from Manhattan and the Lower Hudson Valley up to Poughkeepsie. Additional service is provided to this station in the form of shuttles from Grand Central, as well as select trains on the Harlem and New Haven lines on game days.
The 2002 artwork here is called Wall-Slide by Vito Acconci, which consists of sections of the station walls "sliding" out of place, sometimes out of the station. Wall-Slide forms seating on the IND platforms, and also reveals a mosaic work, Room of Tranquility by Helene Brandt, on the IRT mezzanine.

## IRT Jerome Avenue Line platforms
The 161st Street–Yankee Stadium station is a local station on the IRT Jerome Avenue Line that has three tracks and two side platforms. The 4 stops here at all times.
The station has extra exit stairs to handle stadium crowds at the southern end of each platform, which make the platforms at this station much longer than traditional IRT platforms. These stairs lead to a separate mezzanine and fare control that were built to serve the old Yankee Stadium located across 161st Street; they continue to serve the new Yankee Stadium during events.
The former IRT Ninth Avenue Line connected with the IRT Jerome Avenue Line just north of this station, near 162nd Street. A stub of the Ninth Avenue Line connecting trackway still exists and is visible today.

### Exits
On each side of River Avenue, there is one street stair to each of 161st Street's two medians. There are also two stairs to the southwest corner and one to the southeast corner. The northeast corner has an ADA-accessible elevator and transfer passageway.

## IND Concourse Line platforms
The 161st Street–Yankee Stadium station (161st Street–River Avenue on some signage) is a local station on the IND Concourse Line that has three tracks and two side platforms. It is the southernmost station on the IND Concourse Line within the Bronx.

### Exits
The full-time mezzanine to the west is at 161st Street and River Avenue with four street staircases. The part-time entrance to the east is at Walton Avenue and has two street staircases and a passageway to 161st Street. Before the renovation, there was a full length mezzanine, with Transit Bureau Offices located to one side. After the renovation, the NYPD area was expanded, and public areas inside fare control were sealed, thus dividing the mezzanine into two separate areas. A few staircases to the platforms were also sealed and removed.

# 1691 Oort
1691 Oort, provisional designation 1956 RB, is a rare-type carbonaceous Themistian asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt, approximately 33 kilometers in diameter.
It was discovered on 9 September 1956, by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth and Dutch astronomer Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld at Heidelberg Observatory in south-west Germany. It was later named after Dutch astronomer Jan Oort.

## Orbit and classification
is a member of the Themis family, a dynamical family of outer-belt asteroids with nearly coplanar ecliptical orbits. Oort orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.6–3.7 AU once every 5 years and 7 months (2,054 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.18 and an inclination of 1° with respect to the ecliptic.
It was first identified as 1945 TD at Turku in 1945, extending body's observation arc by 14 years prior to its official discovery observation. Information about an earlier 1917-identification, A917 TD, is not available.

## Physical characteristics
The dark C-type asteroid, classified as a rare intermediate CU-type in the Tholen taxonomy.

### Rotation period
In February 2009, a rotational lightcurve of Oort was obtained from photometric observations taken by French amateur astronomer René Roy. It gave a well-defined rotation period of 10.2705 hours with a brightness variation of 0.38 magnitude (U=3). An international study from 2013, published a concurring, modeled period of 10.2684 hours (n.a.).

### Diameter and albedo
According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Oort measures 33.64 and 37.37 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has an albedo of 0.065 and 0.053, respectively. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.10 and calculates a diameter of 27.13 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 10.95.

## Naming
This minor planet was named in honor of Dutch astronomer Jan Oort (1900–1992), director of the Leiden Observatory (1945–1970), president of the International Astronomical Union (1958–1961), and a well-known authority on stellar statistics and galactic structure.
He overturned the idea that the Sun was at the center of the Milky Way. The Oort cloud, the outermost gravitationally bound region of the Solar System, was also named after him. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 15 February 1970 (M.P.C. 3023).
# 115 (barge)


48°41′53″N 86°39′17″W﻿ / ﻿48.69806°N 86.65472°W

115 (also known as Barge 115, No.115, or Whaleback 115) was an American whaleback barge in service between 1891 and 1899. She was built between May and August 1891, in Superior, Wisconsin (or West Superior, Wisconsin) by Alexander McDougall's American Steel Barge Company, for the "McDougall fleet", based in Buffalo, New York. She was one of a class of distinctive, experimental ship designed and built by McDougall. The whalebacks were designed to be more stable in high seas. They had rounded decks, and lacked the normal straight sides seen on traditional lake freighters. 115 entered service on August 25, hauling iron ore from Superior.
In December 1899, while being towed by the whaleback freighter Colgate Hoyt from Two Harbors, Minnesota, for Lake Erie with a load of iron ore, the two vessels encountered a storm. After 40 hours of slow progress across Lake Superior, 115 broke away from Colgate Hoyt at 6:05 a.m., on December 13. Colgate Hoyt searched for her for four hours, but due to the scarcity of fuel on board, she was forced to proceed to Sault Ste. Marie. After drifting around Lake Superior for five days, 115 crashed into Pic Island, near Marathon, Ontario. Her crew made it to shore in a makeshift raft, walking for several days, before being located by crew from the Canadian Pacific Railway.
The wreck of 115 was located in 1980, at a depth of between 40 and 80 feet (12.2 and 24.4 m) of water.

## History

### Background
115 was a whaleback, an innovative but unpopular ship design of the late 1880s, designed by Alexander McDougall. A Scottish immigrant, Great Lakes captain, inventor and entrepreneur, McDougall developed the idea of the whaleback as a way to improve the ability of barges to follow a towing vessel in heavy seas. Whalebacks were characterized by distinctive hull shapes with rounded tops, lacking conventional vertical sides, and conoidal ends. Their rounded hulls enabled water to easily slide off their decks, minimising friction, and letting them sail quickly and smoothly through the water. Their superstructure was located on turrets mounted on the main deck. The rounded contours of whalebacks gave them an unconventional appearance, and McDougall's ship and barge designs were received with considerable skepticism, resistance, and derision. As they had porcine-looking snouts for bows, some observers called them "pig boats".
After McDougall was unable to persuade existing shipbuilders to try his designs, he founded the American Steel Barge Company in Superior, Wisconsin, in 1888, and built them himself. McDougall actively promoted his design and company by sending the steamer Charles W. Wetmore to London, and starting another shipyard in Everett, Washington, which built the steamer City of Everett. Despite McDougall's further efforts to promote the design with the excursion liner Christopher Columbus, whalebacks never caught on, with only 44 of them being built.

### Design and construction
115 (also known as Barge 115, No.115, or Whaleback 115) was constructed in 1891, in Superior (or West Superior), Wisconsin, by the American Steel Barge Company. Her first hull frames were laid down on May 21, 1891. She was launched on August 15, of that same year. 115 was identical to the barge 116, launched later in August. She was 256 feet (78.0 m) long and 36 feet (11.0 m) wide, and her hull was 18.75 feet (5.7 m) deep. She had a gross tonnage of 1,169 tons, and a net tonnage of 1,110 tons. She was an unrigged barge, and was towed by a steam-powered ship.

### Service history
115 was built by the American Steel Barge Company for the fleet of the same name based in Buffalo, New York. She was enrolled in Duluth, Minnesota, on August 20, 1891, and was given the US official number 53268. Her home port was Buffalo. 115 entered service on August 25, carrying iron ore from Superior, Wisconsin.
On May 11 or 12, 1893, 115 was in tow of Colgate Hoyt, when she was struck by the downbound whaleback freighter Thomas Wilson, which had the whaleback barge 101 in tow. 115 was dry docked in Duluth on May 20, for repairs. 115 broke 16 hull plates on May 3, 1894, when she collided with the steamer Mesaba on Lake George. In 1895, management of the American Steel Barge Company fleet was taken over by Pickands Mather & Company of Cleveland, Ohio. While loaded with iron ore and under tow of the whaleback steamer A.D. Thompson, 115 ran aground in the St. Marys River, below the Sault Ste. Marie Canal in the afternoon on July 18, 1897. She was released on the morning of July 19, after lightering her cargo, which she later reloaded; she sustained no damage in the grounding. In August 1897, 115 was dry docked in West Superior, in order to repair damage she sustained after striking the bottom in an unknown river. Ten of her bottom plates and two of her keel plates needed to be replaced.

### Final voyage
In December 1899, 115 and her towing steamer Colgate Hoyt were in Two Harbors, Minnesota, where 115 loaded 3,000 tons of iron ore bound for Lake Erie, on what was meant to be their final trip of the shipping season. The two vessels left Two Harbors on December 10, and headed for the Soo Locks. 115 was under the command of Arthur A. Boyce, and had a complement of eight crew (including Captain Boyce). As the two vessels left Two Harbors, they sailed into a storm. For 40 hours, Colgate Hoyt and 115 made slow progress across Lake Superior, when at 6:05 a.m. on December 13, 115 broke away from Colgate Hoyt, south of Pic Island. Colgate Hoyt's crew frantically searched for 115 for four hours, but scarcity of fuel on board forced her to proceed to Sault Ste. Marie, where they enlisted tugboats to help search for 115. Initially, 115 and her crew were believed to have been lost.
115 drifted for five days before stranding near Marathon, Ontario, on Pic Island, located on the north shore of Lake Superior, becoming the final shipwreck to occur on the Great Lakes during the 1800s. Her crew made it ashore in 115's small life raft, making multiple trips between the stranded barge and Pic Island until everyone on board reached safety. Some of the crewmen carried with them extra clothes, while others carried food (two loaves of bread and ham). As well as clothes and the food items, the crewmen carried with them candles and grease. After walking around the island for a while, the crewmen discovered an old, roofless log cabin, containing a stove. They fashioned a roof out of tree branches, and spent the night in the cabin. The following morning, the crewmen tore the cabin down, fashioning a makeshift raft out of the wood. They made it ashore on the mainland, and ended up camping in the bush. The next day, they began walking along the shore to the west, camping in the bush that night as well. After walking for four days, the crewmen stumbled upon a Canadian Pacific Railway track. Following the track, the crewmen managed to make it to Middletown, Ontario, at around noon, that same day. Although all of 115's crew survived, her cook's feet were frostbitten. All of 115's crew made it home in time for Christmas. 115 was the second whaleback lost on the Great Lakes.

## 115wreck
The wreck of 115 was discovered in 1980 after a major search by wreck hunter Ryan LeBlanc at a depth of between 40 and 80 feet (12.2 and 24.4 m) of water, on a rock bottom. Maritime historian and author Cris Kohl's book, The 100 Best Great Lakes Shipwrecks – Volume II. erroneously states that 115's bow with its turret is intact, whereas dive footage shot in about 1980 shows that her stern and its turret are intact, instead of the bow. The bow section is broken up. Due to the force with which 115 pounded against Pic Island, there are twisted steel plates located as high as 50 feet (15.2 m) on the cliff she wrecked against. Her intact bell was retrieved around the time she was discovered.# 1725 in France

# 1938 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting
The 1938 elections to select inductees to the Baseball Hall of Fame were conducted along much the same lines as the 1937 vote. Toward the goal of 10 initial inductees from the 20th century, eight had now been selected; members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) were once again given authority to select any players active in the 20th century, excepting active players. The Centennial Commission retained the responsibility of selecting inductees whose contributions were largely as non-players.
As the obvious stars had already been elected, only pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander was selected via the BBWAA ballot. The Centennial Commission selected Alexander Cartwright and Henry Chadwick.

## BBWAA vote
In the BBWAA election, voters were instructed to cast votes for 10 candidates. Any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall upon its opening in the sport's supposed centennial year of 1939. Individuals who had been barred from baseball, though not formally ineligible, no longer received even the minimal support given them in the two prior elections.
A total of 262 ballots were cast, with 2,475 individual votes for 120 specific candidates, an average of 9.45 per ballot; 197 votes were required for election. The balloting was dominated by players of the 1900s and 1910s, rather than those of the more recent two decades; the results were announced in January 1938. The sole candidate who received at least 75% of the vote and was elected is indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been selected in subsequent elections are indicated in italics:

## Centennial Commission
Once again, the Hall opted to have this small committee of six members select inductees "for outstanding service to base ball apart from playing the game." After selecting five individuals in 1937, the Commission chose two inductees at the major league winter meetings in New York City in December 1938, though the choices were not announced until the following month:
- Alexander Cartwright, who had been instrumental in organizing some of the game's first teams in the 1840s and had moved to establish the game's first consistent playing rules; and
- Henry Chadwick, a sportswriter who had tirelessly promoted the game in the late 19th century and had been a major force in revision of the rules through several decades. To date he is the only sportswriter (or commentator) to be inducted into the real Hall of Fame (as opposed to the writers' and commentators' "wings").

Their song "Something's Burning" was featured on the soundtrack to the 1997 film All Over Me, and "Just Another Day," their collaboration with Pale 3, was featured on the soundtrack to the 2000 film The Princess and the Warrior.

# 1939 in chess
The below is a list of events in chess in 1939.

## Chess events in brief
- Last (21st) edition of Howard Staunton's The Chess-Player's Handbook is published.
- 21 August-19 September 1939 - the 8th Chess Olympiad (known at the time as the Hamilton-Russell Cup) is held in Buenos Aires. Germany wins the gold medal (Erich Eliskases on first board), Poland silver (Savielly Tartakower on first board), and Estonia bronze (Paul Keres on first board).[1]
- The 7th Women's World Championship is held in conjunction with the Olympiad. Vera Menchik-Stevenson (England) retains her title. She won, scoring 18/19, followed by Sonja Graf (16/19), Berna Carrasco (15.5/19), etc.
- Political refugees - At the conclusion of events, many participants decided to stay in Argentina or moved elsewhere in South America, rather than face an uncertain future by returning to Europe in the midst of World War II. The players affected included Miguel Najdorf, Paulino Frydman, Gideon Ståhlberg, Erich Eliskases, Paul Michel, Ludwig Engels, Albert Becker, Heinrich Reinhardt, Jiří Pelikán, Karel Skalička, Markas Luckis, Movsas Feigins, Ilmar Raud, Moshe Czerniak, Meir Rauch, Victor Winz, Aristide Gromer, Franciszek Sulik, Adolf Seitz, Chris De Ronde, Zelman Kleinstein, Sonja Graf and Paulette Schwartzmann.[2] Most of them were Jewish and had come to Buenos Aires in August 1939 on the Belgian steamer "Piriapolis".[3] The ship has therefore come to be regarded as the epitome of Noah's Ark for a generation of chess players. Significantly, all members of the German team also chose not to return to Nazi Germany.
- 27 December 1939 - American Chess Federation and National Chess Federation form the United States Chess Federation (USCF).[4]

# 135th Motor Rifle Division
The 135th Motor Rifle Division was a mechanized infantry division of the Soviet Army during the Cold War. The division was formed in 1960 as a mobilization division in Luhansk. It became a regular division in 1968 and was transferred to Lesozavodsk. In 1989, it was renamed the 130th Machine Gun Artillery Division (Military Unit Number 92910) and continued to serve in the Russian Ground Forces. It was reduced to the 245th Weapons and Equipment Storage Base in 2009.

## History
On 22 November 1960, the 135th Motor Rifle Division was activated as a mobilization division in Luhansk. It was co-located with the 4th Guards Motor Rifle Division. In April 1968, the division became a regular unit and was transferred to Lesozavodsk as a result of increased Sino-Soviet tensions.
The division's 199th Motor Rifle Regiment fought in the Damansky Island incident in March 1969 during the Sino-Soviet border conflict, when they were sent into the fight on 15 March to prevent Chinese capture of the island. The 199th had already been deployed ostensibly for exercises at the end of February 1969 as the conflict escalated and on March 2 was ordered to advance to Damansky Island. As the Chinese threaten to overwhelm the border guards, the regiment was committed to battle on 15 March. The 199th remained on the border until the end of March and departed only after the Chinese incursion attempts had ceased. Junior sergeant Vladimir Orekhov of the regiment's 5th company was posthumously made a Hero of the Soviet Union for his actions in the battle. The conflict was classified as a border conflict and the participation of the regular Soviet Army in it kept secret until the 1990s, and thus Army soldiers who participated did not automatically receive veteran status.
During the Cold War, the division was maintained at 65% strength. On 1 October 1989, the division became the 130th Machine Gun Artillery Division. The 199th Motorized Rifle Regiment was disbanded and replaced by the 365th Machine Gun Artillery Regiment. In 1994, the 365th Machine Gun Artillery Regiment became the 199th Motorized Rifle Regiment. The division was reduced to the 245th Weapons and Equipment Storage Base under the 2009 Russian military reforms. The base stores equipment planned to be used to form the 93rd Motor Rifle Brigade in event of mobilization. According to 2017 open-source data from milkavkaz, the storage base contains 18 BM-21 Grad, 36 152mm 2S1 Gvozdika, 18 120 mm 2S12 Sani, six 100 mm MT-12 Rapira, 18 9P149 Shturm-S, six BM 9A34(35) Strela-10, 18 57 mm AZP S-60, six ZSU-23-4 Shilka, and 41 T-72.

# 1781 Epsom Derby
The 1781 Epsom Derby was the second running of The Derby - the horse race known as the "greatest turf event in the world".  It took place on 24 May 1781 on Epsom Downs in Surrey, England, and was won by Young Eclipse, owned by gambler Dennis O'Kelly and ridden by Charles Hindley.
The previous year, Lord Derby had instigated a race at Epsom Racecourse for three-year-old horses, the name of which had been decided on a coin toss between Derby and Sir Charles Bunbury, a member of the Jockey Club (although it may have been that Bunbury deferred to Derby, who was his host at the time). The race was over 1 mile (although in 1784 that would be increased to 1 mile 4 furlongs, the distance it has been ever since).
The 1780 race had been won by Bunbury's horse Diomed, which was the favourite, beating Boudrow, owned by Dennis O'Kelly. In this second running of the race, it was O'Kelly who had the winner, Young Eclipse, another colt by the pre-eminent sire of the day, Eclipse. He beat Sir John Lade's Crop who was much the more fancied of the runners, going off 5/4 favourite.

Parliamentary elections were held in Portugal on 5 and 19 June 1842.

## Electoral system
Prior to the elections the Constitutional Charter of 1826 was reintroduced on 10 February, having previously been in force from 1826 to 1828 and again from 1834 until 1836. The direct electoral system used in 1838 and 1840 was replaced by an indirect system in which voters elected provincial assemblies, who in turn elected members of the Chamber of Deputies; the appointed Chamber of Most Worthy Peers replaced the elected Senate as the upper house.
The 145 members of the Chamber of Deputies were elected from multi-member constituencies, with 119 representing the mainland, 12 representing islands and 14 representing overseas colonies.

## Campaign
On 30 March the Miguelistas and Setembristas formed a united front under the name 'Broad Coalition'. The Cartistas released a manifesto on 3 June, which was critical of Minister and Secretary for Royal State Affairs Costa Cabral.

## Results
When the Cortes Gerais met for the first time on 10 July the government was supported by 72 Cabralista deputies, with only 10 deputies representing the Setembristas, Miguelistas and anti-Cabralistas.

# 1. FC Kaan-Marienborn
1. FC Kaan-Marienborn is a German association football club based in Siegen, that competes in Regionalliga West.

## History
The club was founded on 1 July 2007, taking over the football department of TuS 1886 Kaan-Marienborn, which had existed since 1886. Funded by Christoph Thoma, the former managing partner of Maschinenfabrik Herkules in Kaan-Marienborn, the club was promoted to the Landesliga as early as 2008 and was further promoted to the Westfalenliga two years later. There, the team already reached 3rd place in its first season. In 2016, the team was finally promoted to the Oberliga Westfalen as the runner-up of the Westfalenliga Division 2 and winner of the play-off match against the runner-up of the other division, Delbrücker SC. Two years later, they were promoted to the Regionalliga West. After the 2018–19 season, the team was relegated directly after finishing in second to last place.
In the 2019–20 season, the team again competed in the Oberliga Westfalen with Tobias Wurm, who had previously held the position of assistant coach, moving up to head coach and finishing 9th in the table after 21 matchdays. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, the season was cut short. The question of promotion was decided on a points per game basis. Here, 1. FC Kaan-Marienborn averaged 1.43 points.
The 2020–21 season also ultimately fell victim to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the end of the season, the team was in 6th place in the table (7 matches, 5 wins, 1 draw, 1 loss).
Since the beginning of October 2021, Thorsten Nehrbauer (the coach with whom the team achieved promotion to the Oberliga and Regionalliga) has been back in Kaan and so the club is looking to achieve promotion to the Regionalliga once again. They achieved this goal at the end of the season, gaining promotion to the 2022–23 Regionalliga West.
1. FC Kaan-Marienborn withdrew their senior team after the 2022–23 season due to not being able to fulfill future stadium requirements. Their reserve team, currently playing in the eleventh-tier Kreisliga C, will function as their new senior team from the 2023–24 season onwards.

The first election to Pembrokeshire County Council, was held in January 1889.   It was followed by the 1892 election. The county was divided into numerous single member wards with two or more councillors elected to represent Tenby and Pembroke Dock.

## Overview of the result
1889 was a landmark year in the history of Welsh Liberalism, a coming of age symbolized by the triumph across Wales of Liberal candidates in the inaugural county council elections. The Liberal triumph in Pembrokeshire was not as complete as in other Welsh counties but was nevertheless significant. In the north of the county a number of landed gentry were defeated including James Bevan Bowen of Llwyngwair, former MP for the county of Pembrokeshire.
There were only nine unopposed returns, most of whom were Liberals.

Elections occurred in the middle of President John Tyler's term, during the Second Party System. Tyler had become president on April 4, 1841, upon the death of his predecessor, William Henry Harrison. Elected as vice president on the Whig ticket with Harrison in 1840, Tyler was expelled from the party in September 1841. Members of the 28th United States Congress were chosen in this election. Florida joined the union during the 28th Congress. Whigs kept control of the Senate, but lost control of the House.
Following the 1840 census, the size of the House was reduced by 19 seats. Democrats won massive gains, turning a commanding Whig majority into a dominant Democratic majority.
In the Senate, Democrats picked up one seat, but Whigs retained the majority.

# 100 Ton Chicken
100 Ton Chicken is the third studio album by the blues band, Chicken Shack, released in 1969. This album was Paul Raymond's first album as a member of Chicken Shack, replacing Christine Perfect.
Unlike its predecessors, 40 Blue Fingers, Freshly Packed and Ready to Serve and O.K. Ken?, 100 Ton Chicken did not reach the UK Albums Chart. AllMusic noted "Sorry, but this chicken laid a 20-ton rotten egg".
The entire album and the rest of the Chicken Shack sessions on Blue Horizon were made available on the CD compilation Chicken Shack - The Complete Blue Horizon Sessions (2007). Several outtakes from the 100 Ton Chicken sessions were made available for the first time on this compilation. "Smartest Girl in the World" and "Hideaway" were both unpublished outtakes. "The Things You Put Me Through" was also an outtake but it had been released as the B side to the single "Tears in the Wind".

# 10th Area Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)
The 10th Area Fleet (第十方面艦隊, Dai-jyū Hōmen Kantai) was a fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) established during World War II as a result of IJN commands being isolated in the Philippines.

## History
The commander in chief of the 1st Southern Expeditionary Fleet based in Singapore was named commander in chief of the newly created Tenth Area Fleet on 1 February 1944. As the Southwest Area Fleet command staff was isolated in the Philippines, a new command structure was necessary to direct the 1st and 2nd Southern Expeditionary Fleet, and the surviving elements of the 5th Fleet. It was supported by the 13th Air Fleet. The 10th Area Fleet had responsibility for the defenses of Indonesia and Indochina. It lost most of its combat capability at the Battle of the Malacca Strait and when Ashigara was sunk by HMS Trenchant and was disbanded at the end of the Pacific War.
The 10th Area Fleet was a theatre command and its name was taken sequentially from the numbered fleets rather than from the area in which it was located.

# 111th Fighter Escadrille
The 111th Fighter Escadrille of the Polish Air Force (Polish: 111. eskadra myśliwska) was one of the fighter units of the Polish Army. Created in 1921, immediately after the end of the Polish-Soviet War, the unit inherited the traditions of the famous war-time Polish 7th Air Escadrille (known as the Kościuszko Squadron), in which both Polish and American volunteers served.

## History
The unit was created on May 19, 1921 out of two previously-existing units, the Polish 7th Air Escadrille and the Polish 18th Air Escadrille of the 1st Air Regiment. Initially it was manned mostly by the American veterans of the earlier unit, including Cedric Fauntleroy. However, soon afterwards most of the American pilots returned home and the unit was manned with Polish officers.  Nonetheless, it retained the roundel and the traditions of the Polish-American unit. In 1934 the unit was the first to receive the then-modern PZL P.11c fighters. In 1936 the escadrille was stationed in Sarny and was providing air cover for a construction of border fortifications at the frontier with the Soviet Union. During one of the sorties Lt. Witold Urbanowicz, later to become one of the fighter aces of World War II, downed a Soviet Polikarpov R-5 biplane reconnaissance aircraft flying a reconnaissance mission over the area.
In 1939 it was attached to the Pursuit Brigade, a large fighter unit held in reserve of the Commander in Chief. As part of the Polish 3rd Squadron of the 1st Air Regiment (Polish: III/1 dywizjon myśliwski) under Zdzisław Krasnodębski, the unit was stationed at the airfield at Zielonka and provided air cover for the nearby city of Warsaw. During the Polish September Campaign the first sortie — and the first success of the escadrille — took place on September 1, at 4 in the morning, that is roughly an hour before the fights for Westerplatte started, an event which is usually taken as the starting point of World War II.  The escadrille was scrambled to intercept a large formation of enemy bombers escorted by Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighters.  Over the area of Modlin the enemy formation was intercepted and forced to retreat, dropping their bombs on uninhabited areas. Lt. Palusiński downed one enemy Dornier Do 17 and probably damaged another plane of that type. Palusiński himself was wounded by enemy fire.
Later that day another bombing raid on Warsaw was intercepted, this time covered by Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters. During the air battles over Warsaw the escadrille's commanding officer managed to down one enemy fighter, but was then shot down and wounded. The command was taken over by his deputy, Lt. Januszewicz. The following day the escadrille did not encounter any enemy formations. On September 3 a flight from the escadrille, providing air cover for Col. Stefan Pawlikowski intercepted a formation of enemy Bf 110 fighters over Wyszków. Lt. Januszewicz and Corporal Karubin downed two enemy fighters. However, at the same time another flight led by Ferić was dispersed and had to return to base. One of its pilots did not return to the escadrille until September 10.
On September 4 the escadrille was transferred to the Zaborów airfield near Leszno. Its commanding officer downed a Junkers Ju 87 (other sources mention a Dornier Do 17). The following day Strzembosz and Januszewicz scored another two victories, this time over a Bf 110 and Ju 87, respectively. On September 6 Januszewicz scored yet another Ju 87. On September 7 the escadrille was evacuated to eastern Poland and was stationed in the Kierz airfield near Lublin. It briefly operated from the airfield of Ostrożec near Łuck, but returned to Lublin area the following day (Strzelce and Werba airfields). The last confirmed victories were over a reconnaissance Henschel Hs 126 on September 9 (Ferić) and Heinkel He 111 on September 11 (Wróblewski). Altogether during the campaign the unit downed 8 enemy planes (other sources mention 7½) while losing 9 of its own PZL P.11c fighters.
After the Soviet invasion of Poland on September 17, the unit was evacuated to Romania together with its 4 remaining fighters. From there the majority of the pilots were able to get to France and the United Kingdom, where many joined the Polish Air Forces in exile. The traditions of the escadrille, as well as its predecessor, was then continued by the No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron, one of the most successful Allied fighter units of the war.

## Crew and equipment
On September 1, 1939, the escadrille had 9 planes, including 7 PZL P.11c and 2 PZL P.11a. Throughout the war it received an additional PZL P.11c as reinforcement. The air crew consisted of kapitan (Captain) Gustaw Sidorowicz, his deputy porucznik (Lieutenant) Wojciech Januszewicz and 16 other pilots:
1. ppor. Mirosław Ferić
2. ppor. Janusz Łabicki
3. ppor. Jerzy Palusiński

# 1849–50 Massachusetts gubernatorial election
The 1849–50 Massachusetts gubernatorial election consisted of an initial popular election held on November 12, 1949 that was followed by a legislative vote held on January 7, 1850. The ultimate task of electing the governor had been placed before the Massachusetts General Court because no candidate received the majority of the vote required for a candidate to be elected through the popular election. Incumbent Whig Governor George N. Briggs won the legislative vote and was therefore elected, defeating Democratic nominee George S. Boutwell and Free Soil nominee Stephen C. Phillips.

## General election

### Candidates
- George N. Briggs, Whig, incumbent Governor
- George S. Boutwell, Democratic, state banking commissioner, former State Representative[2]
- Stephen C. Phillips, Free Soil, former U.S. Representative, former Mayor of
Salem, Massachusetts

### Legislative election
As no candidate received a majority of the vote, the Massachusetts General Court was required to decide the election. Under Article III of the Constitution of Massachusetts, the House of Representatives chose two candidates from the top four vote-getters, the Senate electing the Governor from the House's choice.
Contemporary sources only record the House's vote as Briggs 157, Phillips 63, Boutwell 59, which would result in the nomination of Briggs but not Boutwell.
The legislative election was held on January 7, 1850.

# 1893 Swiss animal protection referendum
A referendum on animal protection was held in Switzerland on 20 August 1893. Voters were asked whether they approved of prohibiting butchering without the animals being anaesthetised. The proposal was approved by 60.1% of voters and a narrow majority of cantons.

## Background
The referendum was a popular initiative, forced by the collection of 100,000 signatures. As it involved changing the constitution, a double majority of both votes and cantons was required for the proposal to pass.

# 122nd Guards Rifle Division
The 122nd Guards Rifle Division was an elite infantry division of the Red Army. It was formed in June 1945 from the 2nd formation of the 249th Estonian Rifle Division. The division was stationed in Estonia and disbanded in 1946.

## History
The division was formed on 28 June 1945 from the re-designated 249th Estonian Rifle Division. On the same date the entire 8th Estonian Rifle Corps was raised to Guards status as the 41st Guards Rifle Corps. On its formation the 122nd Guards inherited the honorific title and decorations of the 249th, with its full title being 122nd Guards Rifle Estonian, Order of Lenin, Order of the Red Banner Division. Col. August Yulianovich Feldman was in command of the 249th up to the German surrender and likely continued in command of the 122nd Guards until he was appointed deputy commander of the 41st Guards Corps.
This re-designation took place nearly two months after V-E Day, but before the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, so technically the 122nd Guards can be considered a wartime formation, although it did not see combat in Manchuria. The division was stationed in Tartu and was disbanded there in 1946.
